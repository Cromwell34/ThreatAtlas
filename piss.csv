Both nations have thousands of warheads deployed on military bases with operational forces.While ""the sizes of their respective nuclear arsenals (i.e. useable warheads) seem to have remained relatively stable in 2022,"" the think tank noted, ""transparency regarding nuclear forces declined in both countries in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.""China has the third-largest arsenal of operational nuclear warheads with 410—up from 350 last year—followed by France (290) and the United Kingdom (225).Nuclear-armed nations also collectively possess thousands of retired warheads that are awaiting dismantlement. The total worldwide inventory of nuclear weapons, including retired and operational arms, was 12,512 at the beginning of this year.But SIPRI found that ""the number of operational nuclear weapons started to rise as countries' long-term force modernization and expansion plans progressed.""""Global reductions of operational warheads appear to have stalled,"" the think tank observed, ""and their numbers are rising again.""Dan Smith, SIPRI's director, said the new research underscores the ""urgent need to restore nuclear diplomacy and strengthen international controls on nuclear arms.""""In this period of high geopolitical tension and mistrust, with communication channels between nuclear-armed rivals closed or barely functioning, the risks of miscalculation, misunderstanding, or accident are unacceptably high,"" said Smith. ""There is an urgent need to restore nuclear diplomacy and strengthen international controls on nuclear arms.""The new research comes in the wake of several developments that alarmed nonproliferation campaigners, including Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the New START nuclear treaty with the U.S. amid elevated tensions over Ukraine.Additionally, the Biden administration released a Nuclear Posture Review that left open the possibility of a nuclear first strike, violating the president's pledge to ensure that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is only used for deterring and, if necessary, retaliating against a nuclear attack.""Both the U.S. and Russia have opposed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons—which bars signatories from using, threatening to use, developing, or stockpiling nukes—and have been accused of flouting their obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.""Most of the nuclear-armed states are hardening their rhetoric about the importance of nuclear weapons, and some are even issuing explicit or implicit threats about potentially using them,"" said Matt Korda, associate researcher with SIPRI's weapons of mass destruction program.

The children, aged 1 through 13, survived a May 1 plane crash that killed their mother and two other adults and were found on Friday in Caqueta province after weeks of searching by the military and Indigenous communities.
Their ordeal began in the early hours, when the Cessna 206 aircraft carrying seven people and traveling between Araracuara airport in Caqueta and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure.
""They will tell their stories and you will hear them,"" said Manuel Ranoque, the father of the 1-year-old and 5-year-old siblings, after visiting them at Bogota's military hospital.
""It's not easy to ask them because the children went 40 days without eating well, so I have not been able to get information from the oldest child,"" Ranoque told reporters.
Ranoque also told reporters the children's mother had survived for four days after the crash, an account disputed by another family member who also spoke to journalists. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -At least 10 people died and 25 were injured after a chartered bus carrying wedding guests rolled off a ramp at a roundabout in the Hunter region in Australia's New South Wales (NSW) state, police said on Monday.
The accident occurred around 11:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) on Sunday near the town of Greta, about 180 km (112 miles) northwest of Sydney, in an area famous for its vineyards and wedding spots.
""I understand they had been at a wedding together, it's my understanding they were travelling together ... presumably for their accommodation,"" NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Tracy Chapman said during a televised media briefing.
At this stage, it appeared to be a single-vehicle accident, Chapman said. Police were still trying to identify all the passengers, she said. Some people could be trapped beneath the bus, which was lying on its side.
The driver of the bus, a 58-year-old man, was under arrest and expected to be charged over the accident. He had been taken to hospital for mandatory testing.
Heavy fog was present in the area at the time but the cause of the accident had not been determined, Chapman said.
The two worst bus accidents in New South Wales state were head-on collisions within two months of each other in 1989 that killed 35 and 21 people each. Eighteen people died in 1973 when a tourist bus plunged down a slope after a brake failure.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to the families of the people killed and injured.
""All of us know the joy of going to a wedding ... they are some of the happiest times that you can have. For a joyous day like that in a beautiful place to end with such terrible loss of life and injury is so cruel and so sad and so unfair,"" Albanese told reporters.
The Wandin Valley Estate winery which hosted the wedding was closed on Monday, a public holiday, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported.
""We are deeply saddened to hear of the bus crash overnight that has claimed the lives of some of our guests,"" ABC reported, citing a statement from the vineyard.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran's supreme leader on Sunday said a deal with the West over Tehran's nuclear work was possible if the country's nuclear infrastructure remained intact, amid a stalemate between Tehran and Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear pact.
Months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since September, with both sides accusing each other of making unreasonable demands.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's guarded approval comes days after both Tehran and Washington denied a report that they were nearing an interim deal under which Tehran would curb its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
""There is nothing wrong with the agreement (with the West), but the infrastructure of our nuclear industry should not be touched,"" Khamenei said, according to state media.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined specific comment on Khamenei's remarks, reiterating the Biden administration stance that the United States ""is committed to never allowing Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.""
""We believe diplomacy is the best way to achieve that goal on a verifiable and durable basis, but the President has also been clear that we have not removed any option from the table,"" he said, alluding to the possibility of military action.
""We will not characterize the nature of an Iranian leader's remarks,"" the spokesperson added.
The 2015 agreement limited Iran’s uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms, in return for lifting international sanctions.
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump exited the pact in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy, leading Tehran to gradually move well beyond the deal's nuclear restrictions and reviving U.S., European and Israeli fears that Iran may seek an atomic bomb.
Echoing Iran's official stance for years, Khamenei said the Islamic Republic has never sought to build a nuclear bomb.
""Accusations about Tehran seeking nuclear weapons is a lie and they know it. We do not want nuclear arms because of our religious beliefs. Otherwise they (the West) would not have been able to stop it,"" Khamenei said.
Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters, said the country's nuclear authorities should continue working with the U.N. nuclear watchdog ""under the framework of safeguards.""
However, Khamenei called on Iranian authorities not to yield to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) ""excessive and false demands,"" adding that a law passed by Iran's hardline parliament in 2020 had to be respected.
Under the law, Tehran would suspend IAEA inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment if sanctions are not lifted.
""This is a good law ... which must be respected and not violated in providing access and information (to the IAEA),"" Khamenei said.
Last month, the IAEA reported limited progress over disputed issues with Iran, including re-installing some monitoring equipment originally put in place under the 2015 pact that Tehran ordered removed last year.

COLONELGUNJ, India (Reuters) - The chief of the Wrestling Federation of India, under police investigation for suspected sexual misconduct after accusations by female athletes, held a political rally on Sunday in his first public appearance since the probe was launched in April.
Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, also a federal lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party, is the subject of a criminal case filed by seven female wrestlers who accused him of groping young athletes at training camps and tournaments.
Singh has denied all the allegations. Delhi police are investigating and will submit their findings before a trial court on Thursday.
""I will not comment on the allegations. I am waiting for the court order on this case,"" Singh told reporters at the Sunday gathering near his political constituency in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
Clad in a saffron robe and turban typically worn by Hindu monks, Singh told a crowd of supporters in scorching heat that he would continue to implement policies introduced by Modi and was committed to serving the people.
Attendees shouted ""long live our lawmaker"" and ""we stand with you"" as they gathered for the rally.
Singh, a six-term member of parliament, also runs about 50 private educational centres in and around his political constituency.
He has been the president of the Wrestling Federation of India for nearly a decade. His son is a local lawmaker and also an official at the federation.
The accusations sparked protests by India's top wrestlers and other athletes, at times drawing a heavy-handed response from authorities who briefly detained or forcibly dispersed the participants.
Images of athletes being dragged away and carried off in buses went viral, sparking criticism from leading athletes and opposition politicians. Wrestlers eventually secured meetings with government ministers after threatening to throw their medals into the Ganges River.
The incidents have shone a spotlight on the government's response to criminal complaints against an influential member of Modi's ruling party, and spurred Delhi police to open two investigations against Singh in April, including one under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
Global sports organisations have also weighed in on the case.
United World Wrestling, the sport's international governing body, issued a statement condemning the brief detentions of wrestlers during protests and criticised a lack of results in the investigations against Singh.
This month, Sport and Rights Alliance, a global coalition of non-governmental organisations that promotes human rights in sports, urged the International Olympic Committee to ensure a transparent, independent and impartial investigation into the allegations.
""It takes a lot of courage to break the silence and disclose a case of sexual abuse,"" network coordinator Joanna Maranhao said.

442,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,"Kherson's unending nightmare through occupation, shelling and now floods","Sun, 11 Jun 2023 09:03:54 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/kherson-s-unending-nightmare-through-occupation-shelling-and-now-floods-2661188312/,"By Max Hunder
KHERSON, Ukraine (Reuters) - For Kherson resident Iryna Radetska, the catastrophic flooding of her city after the giant Kakhovka dam was destroyed is the latest chapter in more than a year of wartime suffering.
""They say a new love kills the old one. Maybe it's the same with tragedy,"" said 52-year-old Radetska, who is deputy head of a school in the southern Ukrainian city.
Few places have felt the extent of suffering that Kherson has since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Few people bore the brunt of it harder than Radetska, who said she has survived imprisonment, beatings and rockets.
The city, which had a peacetime population of 280,000, was occupied by Russian forces on March 2, 2022. It was liberated by Ukrainian troops in early November, but since then has been regularly shelled by Russian forces from the east side of the Dnipro River.
In the latest setback, large areas of Kherson and villages nearby were submerged last week after the Kakhovka dam, 55 km (35 miles) upstream, was destroyed. Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other for causing the damage.
These days, Radetska's school teaches only online due to the risk of shelling. Pupils include 31 on the Russian-held east bank that was particularly badly hit by the floods, including the town of Oleshky.
""As far as we know, Oleshky was flooded ... the mobile connection there is very bad. They are very limited in their movements. Then there is the psychological question,"" she told Reuters, referring to people's trauma.
HORRORS OF OCCUPATION
Leonid Remyha, chief doctor of one of Kherson's hospitals, recalled the huge flow of people into the facility after the dam burst on Monday. They were wet and upset. ""On the first day we admitted 136 people ... they were all in a state of stress.""
The past week's events have been a fresh tragedy for Radetska and Remyha, who both recounted threats, imprisonment and torture during Russia's occupation.
Reuters could not independently verify their accounts of ill treatment. Moscow has repeatedly denied abuse of civilians or soldiers.
Remyha, who is 69, said Russia's military ordered the hospital to treat its soldiers ""under the barrel of a gun"".
He said the hospital's staff took risks to give illicit assistance to local Ukrainian soldiers left in the city after the occupation.
""We gave them care, we registered them under fake names and surnames so that the FSB wouldn't catch them,"" he recalled, referring to Russia's security service. ""We snuck them out of the hospitals so the local population could take them away and shelter them.""
Remya said that after being fired for his pro-Ukrainian stance, he hid for six weeks but was detained by the FSB on Sept. 20.
""There were interrogations every day, twice. This was all accompanied by abuse ... for instance electric shocks, baton (strikes) on the ribs, legs, knees and fingers,"" he said.
According to Remyha, on the third day of captivity the Russians discovered he was a doctor, and their treatment of him improved slightly. He was released after 10 days.
Radetska also recounted imprisonment and torture under occupation. Over the summer of 2022, she said she turned down offers to return to work at her school.
When she went to the school on Aug. 17 to collect her belongings, she had an argument with the new headmaster, which led to her arrest the next day by FSB officers who told her she faced 25 years in jail on terrorism charges.
""The cell was meant for two people but there were seven of us there,"" she said. ""There were two narrow beds and everyone else slept on the floor.""
Remyha said she was beaten, causing spinal injuries she is still recovering from. She added that she was released after nine days, having been given the choice of recording a video apologising for her actions or execution.
Russia's FSB did not immediately respond when asked to comment on to the allegations made by Remyha and Radetska.
Reuters has previously reported on alleged torture and abuse by Russian authorities in Kherson.
Moscow has rejected allegations of abuse against civilians and soldiers in Ukraine and has accused Ukrainian authorities of staging such abuses in places like Bucha, something which Kyiv dismisses as a lie.
LIBERATION AND SHELLING
Kherson's liberation triggered jubilation from many residents, including Radetska and Remyha. But the euphoria was short-lived given the artillery and rocket fire from across the Dnipro that began to hit the city almost daily.
Radetska said her school had been hit several times, including the day before the dam burst.
""We hadn't even had time to process this, and get used to this thought (of the school being bombed) when another tragedy struck.""
""Today, we probably don't have a single family that hasn't faced the consequences of war whether it's death, destruction or fear. People have become different. Children have become noticeably different; they've become more grown up.""
Like many residents who remain, Radetska is convinced the city will recover and thrive, but she said she expects the process to be long and difficult.
Of the approximately 1,400 children registered at her school, just over 100 are still in Kherson region. The rest are in other regions of Ukraine or abroad.
Remyha said just over half of his hospital staff of around 1,200 before the invasion remained. Of the entire workforce, only 12 fled to Russian-controlled areas when Ukrainian forces returned.
""We have to show the entire world and ourselves that Kherson is a city of freedom-loving people, and despite everything that's happened, we will definitely survive here,"" he said.

China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state relations, a position Taipei strongly rejects. China demands that countries with which it has ties recognise its position.
Taiwan now has formal diplomatic relations with only 13 countries, mostly poor and developing countries in Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

446,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,Zelensky says counteroffensive 'taking place' as Trudeau visits Kyiv,"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 19:08:53 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/zelensky-says-counteroffensive-taking-place-as-trudeau-visits-kyiv/,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (R) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shake hands after talks in KyivKyiv (Ukraine) (AFP) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that a counteroffensive was underway as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Kyiv and criticised Russia over flooding from the breached Kakhovka dam.
""Counteroffensive and defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine: at which stage I will not talk in detail,"" Zelensky said at a joint press conference in Kyiv with Trudeau.
Zelensky commented after Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv's long-expected counteroffensive was already failing.
Russia has reported thwarting Ukrainian attacks in the east and south.
""It's interesting what Putin said about our counteroffensive. It is important that Russia always feels this: that they do not have long left, in my opinion,"" Zelensky said.
He added that he was in daily touch with military commanders, including armed forces chief Valery Zaluzhny, and ""everyone is positive now -- tell that to Putin!""
Trudeau, 51, and Zelensky, 45, hugged each other and used each other's first names as the Canadian leader made his second unannounced visit to Kyiv since full-scale war broke out in February last year.
When asked later Saturday why he stopped short of blaming Russia for the dam collapse, Trudeau said: ""I know there are investigators and there are a lot of questions and intelligence being analysed on what exactly happened to have this dam collapse. 
""But there is no doubt in my mind that absent Russia's invasion of last February, that dam would still be standing today.""
And speaking about Putin, he added: ""He is not someone that I have a particular level of trust or interest in.""
Canada, which hosts a large Ukrainian diaspora, has been one of Kyiv's key allies since the Russian invasion.
It has provided Ukraine with significant military aid, trained more than 36,000 soldiers and adopted sanctions against Moscow.
'Direct consequence'
Trudeau denounced Russia's role in the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday.
The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparked fears of humanitarian and environmental disasters.
Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up the dam, while Moscow says Kyiv fired on it.
In his daily address, Zelenksy condemned the ""shameful indifference"" from the international community to the fallout of the dam's destruction, including the failure to ""form and send a rescue mission to the occupied territory"" or ""come out with clear and strong statements condemning this latest Russian war crime.""
He urged international organisations to come to the aid of those in Russian-occupied territories.
Pledging 10 million Canadian dollars (US $7.5 million) in new funding for flood relief, Trudeau said Russia ""will be held to account"" for its actions in Ukraine.

Pilot training - 

The Canadian leader said he would provide 500 million Canadian dollars in new funding for military assistance to Ukraine.
He also pledged Canada would be part of the multinational efforts to train Ukraine's fighter pilots.
Earlier in the day Trudeau placed flowers by a wall of remembrance displaying the faces of soldiers killed in combat while a military orchestra played.
He also visited an open-air exhibition featuring destroyed Russian military vehicles.
Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Oleksandr Polishchuk handed Trudeau a box that he said held shrapnel from a rocket that fell on the Black Sea port city of Odesa.
He said the gift was intended to remind Trudeau of Ukraine's suffering from Russian strikes.
Iran must 'end support' for Russia
Three people were killed early Saturday in a fire sparked by debris from shot-down Russian drones in the Odesa region.
French President Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi to ""immediately end"" Tehran's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which involves supplying Moscow with attack drones, the Elysee said.
Macron in a telephone call underlined the serious ""security and humanitarian consequences"" of Iran's drone deliveries ""and urged Tehran to immediately end the support it thus gives to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine"", said a statement.
The call came a day after White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Russia was receiving materials from Iran to build a drone factory on its territory that ""could be fully operational early next year"".
The United States has said that Russia has received hundreds of Iranian attack drones to attack Kyiv and ""terrorise"" Ukrainians, a charge denied by Tehran.

447,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,The 40-day Colombian jungle search for four missing children,"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 12:23:30 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/the-40-day-colombian-jungle-search-for-four-missing-children/,"For 40 days after their plane crashed, four Indigenous children were lost in the Colombian Amazon rainforest.A major search operation, with rescuers finding a steady string of clues about their whereabouts, came to an end on Friday with the discovery of the children alive.They were flown to the capital Bogota early Saturday, where ambulances awaited. AFP looks at the timeline of events.Doomed flightOn the morning of May 1, a Cessna 206 plane run by Avianline Charters left a jungle area known as Araracuara to head for San Jose del Guaviare, one of the main towns in the Colombian Amazon.On board were the pilot, an Indigenous leader of the Huitoto community, as well as Magdalena Mucutui Valencia and her four children -- aged 13, nine, four and 11 months.Minutes after starting the 350-kilometer (217-mile) flight over the jungle, the pilot reported engine problems and the plane disappeared from radar.According to officials, the four Huitoto siblings boarded the plane with their mother to flee threats from members of an armed group.Signs of lifeBetween May 15 and 16, soldiers found the bodies of the pilot and the two adults in the Caqueta area. The plane was stuck vertically in thick vegetation, with its nose destroyed.They did not locate the children.A sniffer dog found the baby's bottle in a secluded spot near the crash site.More than 100 military personnel were deployed to the area, suspecting there was at least one survivor.The search was joined by dozens of Indigenous people from nearby villages who are accustomed to traveling through the Amazon -- home to jaguars, snakes and other predators, as well as armed drug smuggling groups.Military aircraft dumped 10,000 flyers into the forest with survival tips and instructions in Spanish and the children's own Indigenous language.An air force helicopter also broadcasted an audio recording of the children's grandmother, urging them to stay put.Shoes, clothes and half-eaten fruit were found among the trees.About 2.5 kilometers from the crash site, soldiers also found a camp abandoned by guerrillas.Premature announcementHeavy rainfall and giant trees that can grow up to 40 meters (130 feet) tall made the ""Operation Hope"" search difficult.Three weeks after the crash, soldiers found diapers and shoes, and claimed that they had passed within 100 meters of the children. The search was reduced to a 20-square-kilometer section of jungle.On May 17, soldiers came across a makeshift shelter, constructed out of sticks and branches. A dog also found scissors and hair ties.On the same day, President Gustavo Petro announced that the children had been found alive. But he retracted the statement a day later, saying he had been given false information.On May 26, the military organized a symbolic celebration for the baby, who turned one year old that day, having spent almost a month lost in the jungle.Finally foundOn June 9, Petro announced that the children were found alive and released a photo showing them surrounded by soldiers and Indigenous people who participated in the search. The children appear thin and have no shoes.""They were alone, they made it on their own. An example of absolute survival that will go down in history,"" the president said.According to the military, rescuers found the children about 5 kilometers west of the crash site.Army rescuers ""immediately took charge of and stabilized"" the four siblings, who were transferred to San Jose del Guaviare, according to the defense minister.They arrived at a military airport in Bogota early on June 10, with ambulances waiting to take them to hospital.© 2023 AFP",https://www.rawstory.com/the-40-day-colombian-jungle-search-for-four-missing-children/,,['Agence France-Presse'],"['San Jose del Guaviare', 'Araracuara', 'Bogota', 'Indigenous', 'Colombian', 'Huitoto', 'Caqueta', 'Amazon']","['Gustavo Petro', 'Avianline Charters', 'Petro', 'Magdalena Mucutui Valencia']",['AFP'],"['The 40-day Colombian jungle search', 'four missing children', 'their plane', 'four Indigenous children', 'the Colombian Amazon rainforest', 'A major search operation', 'rescuers', 'a steady string', 'clues', 'their whereabouts', 'an end', 'Friday', 'the discovery', 'the children', 'They', 'the capital', 'Bogota', 'ambulances', 'AFP', 'the timeline', 'events', 'the morning', 'May', 'a Cessna 206 plane', 'Avianline Charters', 'a jungle area', 'Araracuara', 'San Jose del Guaviare', 'the main towns', 'the Colombian Amazon', 'board', 'the pilot', 'an Indigenous leader', 'the Huitoto community', 'Magdalena Mucutui Valencia', 'her four children', '217-mile', 'the jungle', 'the pilot', 'engine problems', 'the plane', 'radar', 'officials', 'the four Huitoto siblings', 'the plane', 'their mother', 'threats', 'members', 'an armed group', 'Signs', 'May', 'soldiers', 'the bodies', 'the pilot', 'the two adults', 'the Caqueta area', 'The plane', 'thick vegetation', 'its nose', 'They', 'the children', 'A sniffer dog', ""the baby's bottle"", 'a secluded spot', 'the crash site', 'More than 100 military personnel', 'the area', 'at least one survivor', 'The search', 'dozens', 'Indigenous people', 'nearby villages', 'who', 'the Amazon', 'home', 'jaguars', 'snakes', 'other predators', 'armed drug smuggling groups', 'Military aircraft', '10,000 flyers', 'the forest', 'survival tips', 'instructions', 'Spanish', ""the children's own Indigenous language"", 'An air force helicopter', 'an audio recording', ""the children's grandmother"", 'them', 'Shoes', 'clothes', 'half-eaten fruit', 'the trees', 'the crash site', 'soldiers', 'a camp', 'guerrillas', 'Premature announcementHeavy rainfall', 'giant trees', 'that', '40 meters', '130 feet', 'the ""Operation Hope"" search', 'the crash', 'soldiers', 'diapers', 'shoes', 'they', '100 meters', 'the children', 'The search', 'a 20-square-kilometer section', 'jungle', 'May', 'soldiers', 'a makeshift shelter', 'sticks', 'branches', 'A dog', 'scissors', 'hair ties', 'the same day', 'President Gustavo Petro', 'the children', 'he', 'the statement', 'he', 'false information', 'May', 'the military', 'a symbolic celebration', 'the baby', 'who', 'almost a month', 'the jungle', 'June', 'Petro', 'the children', 'a photo', 'them', 'soldiers', 'Indigenous people', 'who', 'the search', 'The children', 'no shoes', 'they', 'it', 'absolute survival', 'that', 'history', 'the president', 'the military', 'rescuers', 'the children', 'the crash site', 'Army rescuers', 'charge', 'the four siblings', 'who', 'San Jose del Guaviare', 'the defense minister', 'They', 'a military airport', 'Bogota', 'June', 'ambulances', 'them', 'hospital', '© 2023 AFP', 'None']"

It makes for an incredible experience,"" she said.Located at Five Corners Square -- once home to an arena where animals would fight to the death -- the acoustic installation titled The Hatchling is a call for empathy with other lifeforms in the era of climate change.""The idea was to bend people's bodies over something other than themselves,"" said Joanna Rajkowska, the artist behind the sculpture.""We care about our well-being so much. It's like a complete obsession... It's time to think about other species,"" she told AFP.- 'The Hatchling speaks' -At around two meters (6.6 feet) high and three meters long, The Hatchling is a larger than life version of a song thrush's blue spotted egg.The color is more intense than the real blue because the sculpture will inevitably fade in the sun.""Inside, instead of a bird, we have a lot of electronics, a lot of circuits and sound transducers... So The Hatchling speaks,"" said Rajkowska.""Literally, like pecking the shell. But also the heartbeat, which is three times faster than the human heart. You can also hear all the movements and the chirping,"" she added.""So it's a whole spectrum of sounds. Basically the desperate life that is trying to get out of the egg.""She teamed up with her musician partner for the recordings, though they do not come from a song thrush, as the stress of the process would have been enormous for a wild bird.""An ornithologist told me that if I take an egg from the nest and then return it, the parents will not accept it... So I decided to find safe conditions,"" Rajkowska said.They came across ""this crazy guy who is trying to revive old species of chickens"" who allowed them to record in his lab as long as they kept the eggs warm.""So we had to really rush to do the recording and put it back in the incubator,"" Rajkowska said.- 'Surreal, unexpected' -The artist is also the creator of a massive fake palm tree that has for years added a tropical note to the Polish capital and even become a popular postcard landmark.Similarly, the egg -- whose top is already speckled with bird droppings, to Rajkowska's amusement -- is meant to be ""surreal, unexpected and slightly out of touch with reality"".Piotr Nowacki, a life-long Warsaw resident, is a fan of the project, which he has visited several times and calls ""a break from routine, somewhat abstract, surprising"".""It also educates (and) draws your attention to nature... It's cool that it's dynamic, that it's alive, right?"" the 36-year-old software engineer told AFP.Rajkowska has also exhibited a series of collages juxtaposing old and new magazine clippings, old photographs of the plaza -- and birds, of course.""I love that they evolved from the dinosaur and they have such a long, long history...

449,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,Women rule on the Greek island of Karpathos,"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 12:09:15 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/women-rule-on-the-greek-island-of-karpathos/," ""Here it is women who command!"" declared Rigopoula Pavlidis, as she sang the virtues of her remote village on the island of Karpathos, one of Greece's rare matriarchal societies.Sitting at a desk across the room painting religious icons, her husband Giannis nodded silently.""My husband can't do anything without me, not even his tax return,"" Pavlidis laughed as she embroidered a traditional dress inside her workshop.In contrast to most of patriarchal Greece, the women of Olympos play a commanding role in village life.Isolated from the rest of the Dodecanese island, the spectacular hillside village has safeguarded this centuries-old tradition, which has survived the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and Italian rule in the 20th.Until the 1980s, there was no asphalt road to Olympos.Among the traditions that survive is a Byzantine-era inheritance system that gives a mother's property to the eldest daughter, said local historian Giorgos Tsampanakis.Rigopoula, the seamstress, is one of the beneficiaries of the tradition. She inherited 700 olive trees from her mother.""The families did not have enough property to divide among all the children... and if we had left the inheritance to the men, they would have squandered it,"" she said.Greek women traditionally moved into their new husband's home upon marriage. In Olympos, the opposite takes place.And women's prominence is also reflected in their names.""The eldest daughter took the first name of the maternal grandmother, unlike the rest of Greece, where it was that of the paternal grandmother,"" said Tsampanakis.""Many women still call themselves by their mother's surname and not their husband's,"" he added.The role of women in Olympos was further strengthened in the 1950s when the village men began to emigrate for work -- mainly to the United States and European countries -- leaving their wives and daughters behind to manage families and farms on their own.'We had no choice'""We had no choice but to work in the absence of the men. It was our only way of surviving,"" recalled 67-year-old Anna Lentakis as she picked artichokes in the hamlet of Avlona near Olympos.A few years ago, Lentakis ran the Olympos tavern.

450,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,Missing children found alive in Colombian Amazon 40 days after plane crash,"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 12:00:24 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/missing-children-found-alive-in-colombian-amazon-40-days-after-plane-crash/,"Four Indigenous children who had been missing for more than a month in the Colombian Amazon rainforest were found alive and flown to the capital Bogota early Saturday.The children, who survived a small plane crash in the jungle, were transported by army medical plane to a military airport at around 00:30 am Saturday (0530 GMT).They were taken off the plane on stretchers, wrapped in thermal blankets, with ambulances waiting to bring them to hospital, AFP journalists said.General Pedro Sanchez, who led the search operation, credited Indigenous people involved in the rescue effort with finding the children.""We found the children: miracle, miracle, miracle!"" was the message he told reporters he received on Friday.President Gustavo Petro announced their rescue and told the media: ""Today we have had a magical day.""""They are weak. Let's let the doctors make their assessment,"" he said.Petro had posted a photo on Twitter showing several adults, some dressed in military fatigues, tending to the children as they sat on tarps in the jungle. One rescuer held a bottle to the mouth of the smallest child, whom he held in his arms.""A joy for the whole country! The 4 children who were lost 40 days ago in the Colombian jungle were found alive,"" he wrote on Twitter.Video shared by the Defense Ministry late Friday showed the children being pulled up into a helicopter as it hovered over the tall trees in almost complete darkness.Originally from the Huitoto Indigenous group, the children -- aged 13, nine, four and one -- had been wandering alone in the jungle since May 1, when the Cessna 206 in which they were traveling crashed.The pilot had reported engine problems only minutes after taking off from a jungle area known as Araracuara on the 350-kilometer (217-mile) journey to the town of San Jose del Guaviare.The bodies of the pilot, the children's mother and a local Indigenous leader were all found at the crash site, where the plane sat almost vertical in the trees.Officials said the group had been fleeing threats from members of an armed group.A massive search involving 160 soldiers and 70 Indigenous people with intimate knowledge of the jungle was launched after the crash, garnering global attention.The area is home to jaguars, snakes and other predators, as well as armed drug smuggling groups, but clues such as footprints, a diaper, and half-eaten fruit led authorities to believe they were on the right track.Worried that the children would continue wandering and become ever more difficult to locate, the air force dumped 10,000 flyers into the forest with instructions in Spanish and the children's own Indigenous language, telling them to stay put.The leaflets also included survival tips, and the military dropped food parcels and bottled water.Rescuers had also been broadcasting a message recorded by the children's grandmother, urging them not to move.According to the military, rescuers found the children about five kilometers (three miles) west of the crash site.'Absolute survival'Huitoto children learn hunting, fishing and gathering, and the kids' grandfather, Fidencio Valencia, had told AFP the children are well acquainted with the jungle.""I just want to see them, to touch them,"" he said early Saturday after learning of their rescue.News came as Petro returned home from Cuba, where he signed a six-month truce with Colombia's last active guerrilla group, the ELN.""Getting closer and attaining peace in the agreement that is moving forward with the ELN... And now I return and the first news is that indeed the Indigenous communities that were in the search and the military forces found the children 40 days later,"" he told reporters in Bogota.""They were alone, they made it on their own. An example of absolute survival that will go down in history,"" he said.With her ""warrior"" spirit, 13-year-old Lesly kept her younger siblings safe, the children's grandmother Fatima Valencia told AFP.Seventeen days after the children went missing, Petro announced that they had been found alive but he retracted the statement a day later, saying he had been given false information.On Friday, he praised ""the effective coordination between the military and the Indigenous people"" during the search, saying it was an ""example of an alliance for the country to follow.""Fidencio Valencia told AFP that the children had been found by a native of Araracuara who had been participating in the search.Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez paid tribute to the various army units' ""unshakeable and tireless"" work, as well as to the Indigenous people who took part in the search.Army rescuers ""immediately took charge of and stabilized"" the four siblings, who were transferred to San Jose del Guaviare, according to the minister, and then later to Bogota.(AFP)",https://www.rawstory.com/missing-children-found-alive-in-colombian-amazon-40-days-after-plane-crash/,,['Agence

452,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,UK hobbyist stuns maths world with 'amazing' new shapes,"Sat, 10 Jun 2023 11:42:36 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/world/uk-hobbyist-stuns-maths-world-with-amazing-new-shapes/,"David Smith, a retired print technician from the north of England, was pursuing his hobby of looking for interesting shapes when he stumbled onto one unlike any other in November.When Smith shared his shape with the world in March, excited fans printed it onto T-shirts, sewed it into quilts, crafted cookie cutters or used it to replace the hexagons on a soccer ball -- some even made plans for tattoos.The 13-sided polygon, which 64-year-old Smith called ""the hat"", is the first single shape ever found that can completely cover an infinitely large flat surface without ever repeating the same pattern.That makes it the first ""einstein"" -- named after the German for ""one stone"" (ein stein), not the famed physicist -- and solves a problem posed 60 years ago that some mathematicians had thought impossible.After stunning the mathematics world, Smith -- a hobbyist with no training who told AFP that he wasn't great at maths at school -- then did it again.While all agreed ""the hat"" was the first einstein, its mirror image was required one in seven times to ensure that a pattern never repeated.But in a preprint study published online late last month, Smith and the three mathematicians who helped him confirm the discovery revealed a new shape -- ""the spectre.""It requires no mirror image, making it an even purer einstein.- 'It can be that easy' -Craig Kaplan, a computer scientist at Canada's Waterloo University, told AFP that it was ""an amusing and almost ridiculous story -- but wonderful"".He said that Smith, a retired print technician who lives in Yorkshire's East Riding, emailed him ""out of the blue"" in November.Smith had found something ""which did not play by his normal expectations for how shapes behave"", Kaplan said.If you slotted a bunch of these cardboard shapes together on a table, you could keep building outwards without them ever settling into a regular pattern.Using computer programs, Kaplan and two other mathematicians showed that the shape continued to do this across an infinite plane, making it the first einstein, or ""aperiodic monotile"".When they published their first preprint in March, among those inspired was Yoshiaki Araki. The Japanese tiling enthusiast made art using the hat and another aperiodic shape created by the team called ""the turtle"", sometimes using flipped versions.Smith was inspired back, and started playing around with ways to avoid needing to flip his hat.Less than a week after their first paper came out, Smith emailed Kaplan a new shape.Kaplan refused to believe it at first. ""There's no way it can be that easy,"" he said.But analysis confirmed that Tile (1,1) was a ""non-reflective einstein"", Kaplan said.Something still bugged them -- while this tile could go on forever without repeating a pattern, this required an ""artificial prohibition"" against using a flipped shape, he said.So they added little notches or curves to the edges, ensuring that only the non-flipped version could be used, creating ""the spectre"".'Hatfest'Kaplan said both their papers had been submitted to peer-reviewed journals. But the world of mathematics did not wait to express its astonishment.Marjorie Senechal, a mathematician at Smith College in the United States, told AFP the discoveries were ""exciting, surprising and amazing"".She said she expects the spectre and its relatives ""will lead to a deeper understanding of order in nature and the nature of order.""Doris Schattschneider, a mathematician at Moravian College in the US, said both shapes were ""stunning"".Even Nobel-winning mathematician Roger Penrose, whose previous best effort had narrowed the number of aperiodic tiles down to two in the 1970s, had not been sure such a thing was possible, Schattschneider said.Penrose, 91, will be among those celebrating the new shapes during the two-day ""Hatfest"" event at Oxford University next month.All involved expressed amazement that the breakthrough was achieved by someone without training in maths.""The answer fell out of the sky and into the hands of an amateur -- and I mean that in the best possible way, a lover of the subject who explores it outside of professional practice,"" Kaplan said.""This is the kind of thing that ought not to happen, but very happily for the history of science does happen occasionally, where a flash brings us the answer all at once.""© 2023 AFP",https://www.rawstory.com/world/uk-hobbyist-stuns-maths-world-with-amazing-new-shapes/,,['Agence France-Presse'],"['US', 'Japanese', 'England', 'Yorkshire', 'East Riding', 'the United States', 'UK', 'Canada', 'German']","['David Smith', '-Craig Kaplan', 'Yoshiaki Araki', 'Roger Penrose', 'Smith', 'Marjorie Senechal', 'Penrose', 'Kaplan', '""Doris Schattschneider', 'Schattschneider']","['Moravian College', 'Smith College', 'AFP', 'Waterloo University', 'Oxford University']","['UK hobbyist', 'maths world', ""'amazing' new shapes"", 'David Smith', 'a retired print technician', 'the north', 'England', 'his hobby', 'interesting shapes', 'he', 'November', 'Smith', 'his shape', 'the world', 'March', 'excited fans', 'it', 'T-shirts', 'it', 'quilts', 'cookie cutters', 'it', 'the hexagons', 'a soccer ball', 'some', 'plans', 'tattoos', 'The 13-sided polygon', 'which', '64-year-old Smith', '""the hat', 'the first single shape', 'that', 'an infinitely large flat surface', 'the same pattern', 'That', 'it', 'the German', '""one stone', 'ein stein', 'the famed physicist', 'a problem', 'that', 'some mathematicians', 'the mathematics world', 'Smith', 'a hobbyist', 'no training', 'who', 'AFP', 'he', 'maths', 'school', 'it', 'all', 'the hat', 'the first einstein', 'its mirror image', 'one in seven times', 'a pattern', 'a preprint study', 'Smith', 'the three mathematicians', 'who', 'him', 'the discovery', 'a new shape', 'the spectre', '""It', 'no mirror image', 'it', 'It', '-Craig Kaplan', 'a computer scientist', ""Canada's Waterloo University"", 'AFP', 'it', 'an amusing and almost ridiculous story', 'He', 'Smith', 'a retired print technician', 'who', ""Yorkshire's East Riding"", 'him', 'the blue', 'November', 'Smith', 'something', 'which', 'his normal expectations', 'shapes', 'Kaplan', 'you', 'a bunch', 'these cardboard shapes', 'a table', 'you', 'them', 'a regular pattern', 'computer programs', 'Kaplan', 'two other mathematicians', 'the shape', 'this', 'an infinite plane', 'it', 'they', 'their first preprint', 'March', 'those', 'Yoshiaki Araki', 'The Japanese tiling enthusiast', 'art', 'the hat', 'another aperiodic shape', 'the team', '""the turtle', 'flipped versions', 'Smith', 'ways', 'his hat', 'their first paper', 'Smith', 'Kaplan', 'a new shape', 'Kaplan', 'it', 'no way', 'it', 'he', 'analysis', 'Tile', 'a ""non-reflective einstein', 'Kaplan', 'Something', 'them', 'this tile', 'a pattern', 'this', 'an ""artificial prohibition', 'a flipped shape', 'he', 'they', 'little notches', 'curves', 'the edges', 'only the non-flipped version', 'the spectre""', 'both their papers', 'peer-reviewed journals', 'the world', 'mathematics', 'its astonishment', 'Marjorie Senechal', 'a mathematician', 'Smith College', 'the United States', 'AFP', 'the discoveries', 'She', 'she', 'the spectre', 'its relatives', 'a deeper understanding', 'order', 'nature', 'the nature', 'order', '""Doris Schattschneider', 'a mathematician', 'Moravian College', 'the US', 'both shapes', 'Even Nobel-winning mathematician Roger Penrose', 'whose previous best effort', 'the number', 'aperiodic tiles', 'the 1970s', 'such a thing', 'Schattschneider', 'Penrose', 'those', 'the new shapes', 'the two-day ""Hatfest"" event', 'Oxford University', 'All', 'amazement', 'the breakthrough', 'someone', 'training', 'maths', 'answer', 'the sky', 'the hands', 'an amateur', 'I', 'that', 'the best possible way', 'the subject', 'who', 'it', 'professional practice', 'Kaplan', 'the kind', 'thing', 'that', 'the history', 'science', 'a flash', 'us', 'the answer', '© 2023 AFP', 'None']"

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Four Indigenous children who were missing for more than five weeks in a jungle in Colombia's south following a deadly plane crash arrived in the capital Bogota early on Saturday for medical treatment.
The siblings were found on Friday in Colombia's Caqueta province according to the country's armed forces and were initially treated by military medics who had been among the search teams searching for them.
The mission to find the four siblings, called Operation Hope, captured the imagination of Colombians as reports of clues to their whereabouts fueled longing they would be found safely despite spending more than a month in the inhospitable jungle.
""We did everything necessary to make the impossible possible, using satellites, using aircraft that launched messages, that launched food, that launched flyers, that launched hope,"" General Pedro Sanchez, commander of the military's joint command for special operations said at an air base in Bogota.
In photos shared by Colombia's military, the four children - three girls and a boy - appeared gaunt as they were being cared for by rescuers.
After the plane carrying the children landed in Bogota, four ambulances were waiting at to collect them and take them to a military hospital for specialist medical care.
They had been missing in the jungle since a Cessna 206 carrying seven people on a route between Araracuara, in Caqueta, and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a mayday alert due to engine failure in the early hours of May 1.
Three adults, including the pilot and the children's mother, died in the crash and their bodies were found inside the plane. The siblings, aged 13, 9, 4, as well as a now 12-month-old baby, survived the impact.

455,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,Russia has received hundreds of Iranian drones to attack Ukraine  White House,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 22:32:40 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/russia-has-received-hundreds-of-iranian-drones-to-ukraine-white-house/,"By Jeff Mason and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House said on Friday that Russia appeared to be deepening its defense cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it is using to strike Ukraine.
Citing newly declassified information, the White House said the drones, or Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), were built in Iran, shipped across the Caspian Sea and then used by Russian forces against Ukraine.
""Russia has been using Iranian UAVs in recent weeks to strike Kyiv and terrorize the Ukrainian population, and the Russia-Iran military partnership appears to be deepening,"" White House spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.
""We are also concerned that Russia is working with Iran to produce Iranian UAVs from inside Russia.""
Kirby said the U.S. had information that Russia was receiving materials from Iran required to build a drone manufacturing plant that could be fully operational early next year.
""We are releasing satellite imagery of the planned location of this UAV manufacturing plant in Russia’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone,"" he said.
The U.S. has previously sanctioned Iranian executives at a defense manufacturer over drone supplies to Russia. Iran has acknowledged sending drones to Russia but said in they past they were sent before Russia's February invasion. Moscow has denied its forces used Iranian drones in Ukraine. A White House official said Iran had transferred several hundred drones to Russia since August.
Support between Iran and Russia was flowing both ways, Kirby said, with Iran seeking billions of dollars worth of military equipment from Russia including helicopters and radars.
""Russia has been offering Iran unprecedented defense cooperation, including on missiles, electronics, and air defense,"" he said.
""This is a full-scale defense partnership that is harmful to Ukraine, to Iran’s neighbors, and to the international community. We are continuing to use all the tools at our disposal to expose and disrupt these activities including by sharing this with the public – and we are prepared to do more.""
Kirby said the transfers of drones constituted a violation of United Nations rules and the United States would seek to hold the two countries accountable.
Britain, France, Germany, the U.S. and Ukraine say the supply of Iranian-made drones to Russia violates a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the Iran nuclear deal.
Under the 2015 U.N. resolution, a conventional arms embargo on Iran was in place until October 2020.
Ukraine and Western powers argue that the resolution includes restrictions on missiles and related technologies until October 2023 and can encompass the export and purchase of advanced military systems such as drones.
The Iranian and Russian missions to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. accusations.
""We will continue to impose sanctions on the actors involved in the transfer of Iranian military equipment to Russia for use in Ukraine,"" Kirby said.
He said a new U.S. advisory issued on Friday aimed ""to help businesses and other governments better understand the risks posed by Iran’s UAV program and the illicit practices Iran uses to procure components for it.""
The advisory highlighted key items sought by Iran for its development of drones, including electronics such as processors and controllers.

456,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,Serbians take to streets in anti-government protests following mass shootings,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 19:48:58 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/serbians-take-to-streets-in-anti-government-protests-following-mass-shootings/,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Serbians joined an anti-government protest in Belgrade on Friday for the sixth time since May 3, blaming a culture of violence for the deaths of 18 people in two mass shootings and calling on the interior minister to resign.
Chanting ""(Serbian President Aleksandar) Vucic out!"" and holding a big banner reading ""Students against violence,"" the protesters gathered in front of the parliament and marched to the government building.
Serbia was rocked last month by two unprecedented shootings that happened on consecutive days. On May 3, a teenager killed ten at an elementary school. On May 4, a 21-year-old man killed eight in a town near Belgrade.
Protesters are demanding the resignation of Serbia's interior minister Bratislav Gasic and secret service chief Aleksandar Vulin, who they blame for failing to bring criminal groups to justice.
They also want the withdrawal of national broadcast licences for television channels Pink TV and Happy TV and a ban on some tabloids who they blame for promoting violence.
""I expect the protest to continue, because there is no other way,"" said one of the protesters, who gave her name as Milica. ""I think at one point the government will have to give in, this is a large number of people and eventually they will have to give in to this pressure.""
Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said on Wednesday she was willing to resign and invited the opposition parties - who have backed the protests - for dialogue. But protest leaders have said that they will not speak with the government until all their demands are met.
Vucic says his government is not at fault.
""Is the government to blame for crimes that happened? I cannot accept that,"" he told Reuters on Friday.
Serbia has a deeply entrenched gun culture, and along with the rest of the Western Balkans is awash with military-grade weapons and ordnance in private hands after the wars of the 1990s that tore apart the former Yugoslavia. However, mass shootings are rare.

457,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,France hails ‘hero with backpack’ who intervened in Annecy knife attack,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 18:15:32 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/france-hails-hero-with-backpack-who-intervened-in-annecy-knife/,"The attacker slashed at the 24-year-old man with the knife that he used to savagely stab one young child after another. But rather than run, Henri held his ground – using a weighty backpack he was carrying to swing at the assailant and fend off his blade.French media hailed Henri as “the hero with a backpack” Friday after he was shown in a video grappling with the assailant and charging after him during the knife attack that critically wounded four children between the ages of 22 months and 3 years old, and also injured two adults.Henri, a Catholic pilgrim who is touring France's cathedrals and just happened to be in the Alpine town of Annecy when the attacker rampaged though its lakeside park on Thursday, also got personal words of gratitude Friday from President Emmanuel Macron. The French leader toured hospitals to meet victims and their families and thanked medical workers, police, firefighters, civilians – including Henri – and others whose first aid and swift actions helped save lives.“You experienced very hard moments, traumatizing,"" Macron said. “I am very proud of you.” The president had reassuring words about the victims, saying he was hopeful after speaking to doctors about their injuries and that “normally things will continue to improve.” The most critically injured children, two cousins, were stabilized and “doctors were very confident,"" he said.A wounded British girl “is awake, she's watching television,"" Macron added, speaking to first responders. A wounded Dutch girl also has improved and a critically injured adult – who was both knifed and wounded by a shot that police fired as they detained the suspected attacker – is regaining consciousness, Macron said. The second injured adult was discharged from a hospital and was among the dozens of people that Macron met and thanked, his left elbow still bandaged. “The first thing doctors told me ... is that these children were saved by the swiftness of the collective intervention,” Macron said. “Thank you immeasurably for your courage.” Henri had a heavy backpack on his back and was holding another in his hand when the attacker slashed at him. But despite the blade and the attacker's chilling aggression, Henri still continued to harass him, pursuing the man inside a playground – where he repeatedly stabbed a child in a stroller – and then out of the park again, carrying his backpacks all the while. Henri appeared to hurl one of the backpacks at the assailant at one point and then pick it up again to take another swing.Henri's father, François, said he believed that his son's dogged pursuit helped dissuade the attacker from stabbing more victims before police wrestled him to the ground.“He took a lot of risks – when he wasn’t armed, with just his backpacks,” the father told The Associated Press. “He didn’t stop running after him for many minutes, to stop him from coming back and massacring the kids even more. I think he prevented carnage by scaring him off. Really very courageous.” François asked that their last name not be published, expressing concerns about their family being thrust suddenly and inadvertently into the public eye at a time of shock and outrage in France provoked by the attack's viciousness and the helplessness of its young victims. The profile of the suspected attacker, a 31-year-old Syrian political refugee, also fueled renewed political debate about French migration policies. Critics on the right and far-right of French politics quickly dusted off their arguments that French migration controls are too lax.For his part, Henri shied away from the “hero” label. He said he “tried to act as all French people should act, or would act.” “In that moment, you unplug your brain and react a bit like an animal by instinct,"" he told broadcaster BFMTV. ""It was impossible for me to witness that without reacting.” “I am far from alone in having reacted. Many other people around started, like me, to run after him to try to scare him, push him away. And other people immediately went over to the children to take care of the injured.”Motives for the attack in and around a children's lakeside playground in Annecy remained unexplained. The suspect, who has refugee status in Sweden, remains in custody. Psychiatrists are evaluating him, government spokesman Olivier Veran said.Henri's father said his son “told me that the Syrian was incoherent, saying lots of strange things in different languages, invoking his father, his mother, all the Gods.""“In short, he was possessed by who knows what, but possessed by folly, that’s certain,” the father told the AP.He said he didn't show the disturbing video of the attack to his other children and his wife, and added that he and his wife had trouble sleeping even after learning that Henri was safe.“We thanked providence and his guardian angels,” he said.Most of the children were rushed to a hospital in the French Alpine city of Grenoble – the first stop for Macron and his wife on Friday morning. The fourth wounded child was being treated in Geneva, in neighboring Switzerland. Portugal’s foreign ministry said the seriously injured adult is Portuguese and that he “is now out of danger.” He sustained wounds “while trying to stop the attacker from fleeing from the police,” it said.""For this act of courage and bravery, we thank him profoundly,” the ministry added. French authorities said the suspect had recently been refused asylum in France, because Sweden had already granted him permanent residency and refugee status a decade ago.Lead prosecutor Line Bonnet-Mathis said the man’s motives were unknown, but didn't appear to be terrorism-related. He was armed with a folding knife, she said.(AP) ",https://www.rawstory.com/france-hails-hero-with-backpack-who-intervened-in-annecy-knife/,,['Agence France-Presse'],"['Syrian', 'Switzerland', 'Geneva', 'France', 'Catholic', 'Grenoble', 'British', 'Annecy', 'Portuguese', 'French', 'Sweden', 'Dutch', 'Alpine', 'Portugal']","['Emmanuel Macron', 'François', 'Olivier Veran', 'Line Bonnet-Mathis', 'Henri', 'Macron']","['The Associated Press', 'BFMTV']","['France', '‘hero', 'backpack', 'who', 'Annecy knife attack', 'The attacker', 'the 24-year-old man', 'the knife', 'he', 'one young child', 'another', 'Henri', 'his ground', 'a weighty backpack', 'he', 'the assailant', 'his blade', 'French media', 'Henri', 'the hero', 'a backpack', 'he', 'a video', 'the assailant', 'him', 'the knife attack', 'that', 'four children', 'the ages', '22 months', '3 years', 'two adults', 'Henri', 'a Catholic pilgrim', 'who', ""France's cathedrals"", 'the Alpine town', 'Annecy', 'the attacker', 'its lakeside park', 'Thursday', 'personal words', 'gratitude', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'The French leader', 'hospitals', 'victims', 'their families', 'medical workers', 'police', 'firefighters', 'civilians', 'Henri', 'others', 'whose first aid', 'swift actions', 'lives', 'very hard moments', 'Macron', 'I', 'you', 'The president', 'reassuring words', 'the victims', 'he', 'doctors', 'their injuries', 'things', 'The most critically injured children', 'two cousins', 'doctors', 'he', 'A wounded British girl', 'she', 'television', 'Macron', 'first responders', 'A wounded Dutch girl', 'a critically injured adult', 'who', 'a shot', 'that', 'police', 'they', 'the suspected attacker', 'consciousness', 'Macron', 'The second injured adult', 'a hospital', 'the dozens', 'people', 'that', 'Macron', 'his left elbow', 'The first thing', 'doctors', 'me', 'these children', 'the swiftness', 'the collective intervention', 'Macron', 'you', 'your courage', 'Henri', 'a heavy backpack', 'his back', 'another', 'his hand', 'the attacker', 'him', 'the blade', ""the attacker's chilling aggression"", 'Henri', 'him', 'the man', 'a playground', 'he', 'a child', 'a stroller', 'the park', 'his backpacks', 'Henri', 'the backpacks', 'the assailant', 'one point', 'it', 'another swing', ""Henri's father"", 'François', 'he', ""his son's dogged pursuit"", 'the attacker', 'more victims', 'police', 'him', 'the ground', 'a lot', 'risks', 'he', 'just his backpacks', 'the father', 'The Associated Press', 'He', 'him', 'many minutes', 'him', 'the kids', 'I', 'he', 'carnage', 'him', 'François', 'their last name', 'concerns', 'their family', 'the public eye', 'a time', 'shock', 'outrage', 'France', ""the attack's viciousness"", 'the helplessness', 'its young victims', 'The profile', 'the suspected attacker', 'a 31-year-old Syrian political refugee', 'renewed political debate', 'French migration policies', 'Critics', 'the right', 'far-right', 'French politics', 'their arguments', 'French migration controls', 'his part', 'Henri', 'the “hero” label', 'He', 'he', 'all French people', 'that moment', 'you', 'your brain', 'an animal', 'instinct', 'he', 'broadcaster BFMTV', 'It', 'me', 'I', 'Many other people', 'me', 'him', 'him', 'him', 'other people', 'the children', 'care', '”Motives', 'the attack', ""a children's lakeside playground"", 'Annecy', 'The suspect', 'who', 'refugee status', 'Sweden', 'custody', 'Psychiatrists', 'him', 'government spokesman Olivier Veran', ""Henri's father"", 'his son', 'me', 'the Syrian', 'lots', 'strange things', 'different languages', 'his father', 'his mother', 'all the Gods', 'he', 'who', 'folly', 'that', 'the father', 'he', 'the disturbing video', 'the attack', 'his other children', 'his wife', 'he', 'his wife', 'trouble', 'Henri', 'providence', 'his guardian angels', 'he', 'the children', 'a hospital', 'the French Alpine city', 'Grenoble', 'the first stop', 'Macron', 'his wife', 'Friday morning', 'The fourth wounded child', 'Geneva', 'neighboring Switzerland', 'Portugal’s foreign ministry', 'the seriously injured adult', 'he', 'danger', 'He', 'wounds', 'the attacker', 'the police', 'it', 'this act', 'courage', 'bravery', 'we', 'him', 'the ministry', 'French authorities', 'the suspect', 'asylum', 'France', 'Sweden', 'him', 'permanent residency', 'refugee status', 'Lead prosecutor Line Bonnet-Mathis', 'the man’s motives', 'He', 'a folding knife', 'she', 'None']"

""Today, I graduate from school, which means I'll no longer be able to school strike for the climate.""Thunberg, who is now 20, first made headlines at the age of 15 when she refused to attend school during the three-week lead-up to September Swedish elections in an effort to persuade politicians to take action on the climate crisis.Instead, she sat outside the Swedish parliament with a sign reading, ""School strike for climate,"" in Swedish.""We young people don't have the vote, but school is obligatory,"" Thunberg toldThe Local at the time. ""So this [is] a way to get our voices heard.""""There are probably many of us who graduate who now wonder what kind of future it is that we are stepping into, even though we did not cause this crisis.""On the day of her final school strike, Thunberg took the opportunity to reflect on the movement she helped galvanize.""When I started striking in 2018 I could never have expected that it would lead to anything,"" she tweeted. ""After striking every day for three weeks, we were a small group of children who decided to continue doing this every Friday. And we did, which is how Fridays For Future was formed.""The movement went global ""quite suddenly,"" Thunberg recalled.""During 2019, millions of youth striked from school for the climate, flooding the streets in over 180 countries,"" she said.Fridays For Future found a different way to protest during the coronavirus lockdowns by launching a #digitalclimatestrike.""In a crisis we change our behavior and adapt to the new circumstances for the greater good of society,"" Thunberg wrote at the time.However, one group that hasn't changed their behavior are the world leaders Thunberg has famously excoriated in a number of high-profile speeches. A study released Thursday found that greenhouse gas emissions rose to record levels in the last decade despite the promises of the Paris agreement.""Much has changed since we started, and yet we have much further to go,"" Thunberg tweeted Friday. ""We are still moving in the wrong direction, where those in power are allowed to sacrifice marginalized and affected people and the planet in the name of greed, profit, and economic growth.""Thunberg has spoken up for frontline communities recently. In January, she was detained while protesting the destruction of a German village to pave the way for a coal mine expansion, and in February, she joined with Norwegian Sami activists in opposing the placement of wind turbines on Indigenous land.While graduation is typically a joyful occasion, Thunberg reflected on how the climate crisis has altered her generation's vision of the future.""There are probably many of us who graduate who now wonder what kind of future it is that we are stepping into, even though we did not cause this crisis,"" she wrote.Whatever Thunberg's future contains, climate activism will continue to be part of it.""We who can speak up have a duty to do so. In order to change everything, we need everyone.

459,Raw Story - Celebrating 19 Years of Independent Journalism,"With bows and spears, Indigenous 'warriors' defend the Amazon","Fri, 09 Jun 2023 12:24:39 +0000",https://www.rawstory.com/with-bows-and-spears-indigenous-warriors-defend-the-amazon/,"In a remote pocket of the Brazilian Amazon under siege from illegal fishermen, poachers, loggers and drug traffickers, Indigenous people have taken it upon themselves to defend the land and its resources.With bows, arrows and spears, young men of the Sao Luis village patrol the Javari River by motorboat in the valley of the same name.They call themselves the ""Warriors of the Forest,"" the self-styled heirs of Indigenous rights defender Bruno Pereira, who was murdered in the Javari Valley one year ago along with British journalist Dom Phillips.""We must always be prepared for the worst. But we do not want violence,"" said Lucinho Kanamari, his face painted red, insisting the traditional weapons are merely a ""precaution.""""When we spot intruders, one of us will talk to them. The others stay back, ready to react if things go wrong,"" he told AFP.""We are there to teach, to act as a peaceful deterrent. We talk, we explain.""Lucinho is a member of the Kanamari Indigenous group, one of six in the Javari Valley which holds Brazil's second largest protected Indigenous reservation.Like many others who live here, he takes his surname from his tribe which lives in a part of the rainforest the size of Portugal that contains many of the world's last uncontacted Indigenous groups.- 'Invasions exploded' -The patrolling warriors particularly fear the illegal fishermen in search of pirarucu -- one of the world's largest freshwater fish, its flesh considered a delicacy worth a small fortune.Such poachers are believed to have killed Pereira and Phillips on June 5, 2022, hacking up their bodies and hiding the remains in the jungle.For a while, the crime brought international attention to this threatened corner of the planet long-abandoned under former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and his pro-industrial agenda.""With Bolsonaro, and then Covid, the invasions exploded,"" said Varney Todah da Silva Kanamari, vice president of the Union of Indigenous Peoples of the Javari Valley (Univaja).""As the state abandoned us, we had to assume our responsibilities... We defend what belongs to us: our lakes and forests,"" he said.It is not only fishermen the watchmen fear.There are also narco groups growing coca crops on the Peruvian side of the river, and in April, loggers threatened to kill a Kanamari chief, forcing him into exile.The warriors have built two floating wooden observation posts on the river near their village of Sao Luis. One of the structures has come under fire.Their task is immense and dangerous, their means lacking. The team has only two motorboats and little fuel.The ""warriors"" avoid violent conflict, and in tense situations, withdraw back into the forest.- 'Under threat of death' –With government forces absent from the area, the Sao Luis warriors work with another Indigenous group known by its acronym EVU -- a sort of commando unit attached to Univaja.Pereira helped set up the EVU before his death.EVU members -- about 30 in total -- are equipped with motorized barges, GPS, drones, phones and satellite internet, much of it made possible by private donors. They carry no weapons.EVU volunteers from different Javari Valley communities undergo training by NGOs and security specialists in ""how to intervene, make surveys, confiscate equipment or boats,"" explained EVU co-founder Cristobal Negredo Espisango, known as Tatako.According to Univaja coordinator Bushe Matis, the EVU does not ""replace the state.""""We monitor, we collect information and evidence, and we pass it on to the relevant authorities. Then let the state do its job.""EVU leader Orlando de Moraes Possuelo said a key goal is ""to occupy terrain"" in areas with an abundance of sought-after fish and animals.""We arrive as soon as possible to catch the intruders in the act, before they disappear or return to Peru."" Legally, they cannot detain anyone.Many of the group's members have received threats.""I am under threat of death. I am afraid of course, but there is no other option,"" said Tatako.""The EVU is the only organization that really fights organized crime in the Javari Valley,"" he added.With the return of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to the presidency, many in the Amazon hope help will soon be coming.This week, as Brazil marked the anniversary of the murders of Pereira and Phillips, Lula vowed that ""we will not abandon this struggle for the planet.""""We are fighting to revive policies to protect Indigenous peoples and the Amazon,"" he said in a statement to The Guardian newspaper, to which Phillips was a contributor.But just last week, Brazil's Congress passed bills cutting the powers of Lula's environment and Indigenous affairs ministries and dramatically curbing the protection of Indigenous lands.Univaja's Matis fears for the future.""There can be a tragedy at any moment.

The White House called them inaccurate.The reports said Beijing and Havana have entered into a secret agreement for a Chinese electronic eavesdropping facility to be set up on the Caribbean island that could monitor communications across the southeastern United States.The region includes the US Southern and Central Command headquarters, both in Florida.China will pay Cuba ""several billion dollars"" to be able to construct the facility, the Journal said, citing unnamed US officials.But Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, reading a statement to journalists, called the reports ""totally mendacious and unfounded.""He said Cuba rejects all foreign military presence in Latin America, ""including the many US bases and troops.""""Slander of this kind is often fabricated by US officials,"" the official said.White House national security spokesman John Kirby characterized the Journal story as inaccurate.""I've seen that press report.

But even as SpaceX's development accelerates on the Starship project, there are multiple applications for Falcon Heavy in the years ahead.If you've already had a vehicle developed, the question is how many additional features would it take to keep that as a part of their product offering, if you will.

Mars has a thin atmosphere and a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest-known mountain in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers approximately 40% of the planet and may be a large impact feature. Days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, as the planets have a similar rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. In the distant past, Mars was likely wetter, and thus possibly more suited for life. It is not known whether life has ever existed on Mars.Although we usually think of water being liquid between zero and 100 degrees Celsius, this is only true for pure water at Earth's sea level atmospheric pressure (about 14.7 pounds per square inch or 1014 millibar).The single combination of pressure and temperature at which liquid water, solid ice, and water vapor can coexist in a stable equilibrium occurs at exactly 273.1600 K (0.0100 °C; 32.0180 °F) and a partial vapor pressure of 611.657 pascals (6.11657 mbar; 0.00603659 atm).At sufficiently low pressures there is no liquid phase, but the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation.Can liquid water exist above 100 C? Yes. Temperature of water can not exceed 100 deg celsius only when pressure is 1 atm, as it starts boiling and vaporise. If pressure is increased, then the boiling point can also be increased and water can attain more than 100 degree celsius. This is why indeed pressure cookers cook faster.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7997665367365493691.post-3956988591427723514",Space,['Igor B'],"['the Northern Hemisphere', 'Olympus Mons', 'Valles Marineris', 'Deimos', 'the Solar System', 'Earth', 'Borealis', 'Sun', 'Mars', 'Phobos']",[],['SpaceX'],"['SpaceX - Starship Mission', 'Planet Mars', 'So-called ""Mars', 'the 4th planet', 'the Sun', 'the third largest and massive terrestrial object', 'the Solar System', 'Mars', 'a thin atmosphere', 'a crust', 'elements', ""Earth's crust"", 'a core', 'iron', 'nickel', 'Mars', 'surface features', 'impact craters', 'valleys', 'dunes', 'polar ice caps', 'Mars', 'two small, irregularly shaped moons', 'Phobos', 'Deimos', 'Some', 'the most notable surface features', 'Mars', 'Olympus Mons', 'the largest volcano', 'highest-known mountain', 'the Solar System', 'Valles Marineris', 'the largest canyons', 'the Solar System', 'The Borealis basin', 'the Northern Hemisphere', 'approximately 40%', 'the planet', 'a large impact feature', 'Days', 'seasons', 'Mars', 'those', 'Earth', 'the planets', 'a similar rotation period', 'tilt', 'the rotational axis', 'the ecliptic plane', 'Liquid water', 'the surface', 'Mars', 'low atmospheric pressure', 'which', 'less than 1%', 'the atmospheric pressure', 'Earth', 'Both', ""Mars's polar ice caps"", 'water', 'the distant past', 'Mars', 'life', 'It', 'life', 'Mars', 'we', 'water', 'between zero and 100 degrees', 'this', 'pure water', ""Earth's sea level atmospheric pressure"", 'about 14.7 pounds', 'square inch', 'pressure', 'temperature', 'which', 'liquid water', 'solid ice', 'water vapor', 'a stable equilibrium', 'exactly 273.1600 K', '0.0100 °', 'C', '32.0180 °', 'F', 'a partial vapor pressure', '611.657 pascals', '6.11657 mbar', '0.00603659 atm).At', 'sufficiently low pressures', 'no liquid phase', 'the substance', 'either gas', 'solid', 'water', 'no liquid phase', 'pressures', '0.00600 atm', 'The phase change', 'solid', 'gas', 'sublimation', 'liquid water', '100 C', 'Temperature', 'water', '100 deg celsius', 'pressure', '1 atm', 'it', 'pressure', 'the boiling point', 'water', 'more than 100 degree celsius', 'This', 'pressure cookers', 'Space']"

NASA’s Artemis Program, which will establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, is currently underway. It has 4 main components: The space launch system, or SLS, which will launch astronauts into orbit. The Orion spacecraft, which will transport them to and from the Moon. The human landing system, which will transport them to and from the lunar surface. And Gateway, a space station that will support ground operations. Already, Artemis 1, which launched in November 2022, has successfully demonstrated the SLS and Orion, by sending an un-crewed Orion around the Moon and back to Earth. The next mission, in 2024, will launch astronauts around the Moon and finally, in 2025, they will land on the surface. After this, many more missions will establish a permanent human lunar presence, serving as a stepping stone to Mars and other destinations even further into the solar system!What is NASA?The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the USA federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the USA space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science. NASA has since led most American space exploration, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968-1972 Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. NASA supports the International Space Station and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the crewed lunar Artemis program, Commercial Crew spacecraft, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7997665367365493691.post-2959700065287687005",Space,['Igor B'],"['American', 'Earth', 'USA', 'Moon', 'Mars']",[],"['NASA', 'the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics', 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Project Gemini', 'the Launch Services Program', 'Artemis Program', 'NACA']","['NASA’s $93BN Plan', 'the Moon', 'Futurology', 'Youtube', 'the story', 'two years', 'NASA', 'humans', 'the Moon', 'NASA’s Artemis Program', 'which', 'a permanent human presence', 'the Moon', 'It', '4 main components', 'The space launch system', 'SLS', 'which', 'astronauts', 'orbit', 'The Orion spacecraft', 'which', 'them', 'the Moon', 'The human landing system', 'which', 'them', 'the lunar surface', 'And Gateway', 'a space station', 'that', 'ground operations', 'Artemis', 'which', 'November', 'the SLS', 'Orion', 'an un-crewed Orion', 'the Moon', 'Earth', 'The next mission', 'astronauts', 'the Moon', 'they', 'the surface', 'this', 'many more missions', 'a permanent human lunar presence', 'a stepping stone', 'Mars', 'other destinations', 'the solar system!What', 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'NASA', 'an independent agency', 'the USA federal government', 'the civil space program', 'aeronautics research', 'space research', 'NASA', 'the National Advisory Committee', 'Aeronautics', 'NACA', 'the USA space development effort', 'a distinctly civilian orientation', 'peaceful applications', 'space science', 'NASA', 'most American space exploration', 'Project Mercury', 'Project Gemini', 'the 1968-1972 Apollo Moon landing missions', 'the Skylab space station', 'the Space Shuttle', 'NASA', 'the International Space Station', 'the development', 'the Orion spacecraft', 'the Space Launch System', 'the crewed lunar Artemis program', 'Commercial Crew spacecraft', 'the planned Lunar Gateway space station', 'The agency', 'the Launch Services Program', 'which', 'oversight', 'launch operations', 'countdown management', 'uncrewed NASA launches', 'Space']"

The approximately 10-day mission will test and stress the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems to prove the capabilities and techniques required to live and work in deep space in ways only humans can do.The crew will include three NASA astronauts and one CSA astronaut, demonstrating the agency’s commitment to international partnerships through the Artemis program. Artemis II builds on the successful Artemis I flight test, which launched an uncrewed Orion, atop the SLS rocket, on a 1.4 million-mile journey beyond the Moon to test systems before astronauts fly aboard the systems on a mission to the Moon.Learn more about Artemis at:https://www.nasa.gov/artemis/ Below are some definitions of the space mission:Artemis 2 (officially Artemis II) is the second scheduled mission of NASA's Artemis program, and the first scheduled crewed mission of NASA's Orion spacecraft, currently planned to be launched by the Space Launch System (SLS) in November 2024. The crewed Orion spacecraft will perform a lunar flyby test and return to Earth. Artemis 2 is planned to be the first crewed spacecraft to travel to the Moon, or beyond low Earth orbit, since Apollo 17 in 1972.Originally designated so-called Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2), the mission was intended to collect samples from a captured asteroid in lunar orbit by the now canceled robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission; it was renamed after the introduction of the Artemis program. The mission is also planned to be the first crewed launch from LC-39B since STS-116.The Artemis 2 mission plan objective is to send four astronauts in the first crewed Orion MPCV Spacecraft into a lunar flyby for a maximum of 21 days using the Block 1 variant of the Space Launch System. The mission profile is a multi-trans lunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free return trajectory from the Moon. The Orion spacecraft will be sent to a high Earth orbit with a period of roughly 42 hours. During this time the crew will perform various checkouts of the spacecraft's life support systems as well as an in-space rendezvous and proximity operations demonstration using the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) as a target. When Orion reaches perigee once again, it will fire its main engine to complete the TLI maneuver which will send it to a lunar free return trajectory, before returning to planet Earth.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7997665367365493691.post-8158932761460502135",Space,['Igor B'],"['Houston', 'Ellington Field', 'U.S.', 'Earth', 'Moon']",[],"['NASA', 'the Space Launch System', 'Johnson', 'CSA', 'SLS', 'NASA Johnson Space Center’s', 'NASA Television', 'Canadian Space Agency']","['This Youtube video', 'The NASA Artemis 2 Moon Mission Update', 'an interesting press release', 'Mar', 'press-release', 'nasa-canadian-space-agency', 'artemis-ii-moon-astronautsArtemis', 'the first crewed flight test', 'the agency’s path', 'a long-term scientific and human presence', 'the lunar surface', 'NASA', 'CSA', 'Canadian Space Agency', 'an event', '11 a.m. EDT', '10 a.m.', 'CDT', 'Monday', 'April', 'NASA Johnson Space Center’s Ellington Field', 'Houston', 'the four astronauts', 'who', 'the Moon', 'NASA’s Orion spacecraft', 'Artemis II', 'the mission', 'the first crewed flight test', 'the agency’s path', 'a long-term scientific and human presence', 'the lunar surface', 'The event', 'NASA Television', 'the NASA app', 'the agency’s website', 'Media', 'the event', 'the astronauts', 'their assignments', 'Other experts', 'Artemis missions', 'Additional opportunities', 'crew', 'Tuesday', 'April', 'media', 'NASA', '5 p.m. CDT', 'March', 'U.S. media', 'NASA', '5 p.m.', 'March', 'Media', 'the Johnson newsroom', 'Artemis', 'the first crewed mission', 'NASA’s foundational human deep space capabilities', 'the Space Launch System rocket', 'Orion spacecraft', 'the ground systems', 'them', 'The approximately 10-day mission', 'the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems', 'the capabilities', 'techniques', 'deep space', 'ways', 'only humans', 'The crew', 'three NASA astronauts', 'one CSA astronaut', 'the agency’s commitment', 'international partnerships', 'the Artemis program', 'Artemis', 'the successful Artemis I flight test', 'which', 'an uncrewed Orion', 'the SLS rocket', 'a 1.4 million-mile journey', 'the Moon', 'systems', 'astronauts', 'the systems', 'a mission', 'the Moon', 'Artemis', 'some definitions', 'the space mission', 'Artemis', 'officially Artemis', 'the second scheduled mission', ""NASA's Artemis program"", 'the first scheduled crewed mission', ""NASA's Orion spacecraft"", 'the Space Launch System', 'SLS', 'November', 'The crewed Orion spacecraft', 'a lunar flyby test', 'Earth', 'Artemis', 'the first crewed spacecraft', 'the Moon', 'low Earth orbit', 'Apollo', 'so-called Exploration Mission-2', 'the mission', 'samples', 'a captured asteroid', 'lunar orbit', 'the now canceled robotic Asteroid Redirect Mission', 'it', 'the introduction', 'the Artemis program', 'The mission', 'the first crewed launch', 'LC-39B', 'Artemis 2 mission plan objective', 'four astronauts', 'the first crewed Orion MPCV Spacecraft', 'a lunar flyby', 'a maximum', '21 days', 'the Block 1 variant', 'the Space Launch System', 'The mission profile', 'a multi-trans lunar injection', 'MTLI', 'multiple departure burns', 'a free return trajectory', 'the Moon', 'The Orion spacecraft', 'a high Earth orbit', 'a period', 'roughly 42 hours', 'this time', 'the crew', 'various checkouts', ""the spacecraft's life support systems"", 'space', 'the spent Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage', 'ICPS', 'a target', 'Orion', 'perigee', 'it', 'its main engine', 'the TLI maneuver', 'which', 'it', 'a lunar free return trajectory', 'planet Earth', 'Space']"
993,Igor B News,NASA Plans To Build The First Moon Base,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 01:29:00 +0000",https://www.igorbnews.com/2023/03/nasa-plans-to-build-first-moon-base.html,"Take a look at how NASA Plans To Build The First Moon Base. The Youtube video is interesting.A moonbase is a facility on the surface of the Moon, enabling human activity on the Moon. Moonbases can be for robotic or human use, in both cases not necessarily including lunar habitation facilities. A base might be a step towards so-called colonization of planets.Missions to the Moon have so far realized only temporary single-mission bases, (Tranquility Base being the first), as well as some really small permanent installations. Plans for establishing facilities on the Moon that could enable sustained human activity at the Moon have been proposed and are actively pursued nationally and increasingly internationally by various space agencies.United States concepts:USA has NASA lunar outpost concepts. The USA has run several attempts to design and in some cases develop lunar outposts and the needed missions, the first being from 1959, with the upcoming Artemis missions being the most advanced.The current Artemis Program is interessting. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration of United States (NASA) requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion in order to make another crewed mission around the Moon in 2024, followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. NASA is ready to announce plans to bring together Commercial Human Lander Awards for Artemis Missions on the Moon. This specific program, ""The Artemis Program,"" encompasses NASA's overview for lunar exploration plans. This announcement will go over the first in a series of many more to come complex missions. Artemis I started the program as an uncrewed flight test to demonstrate the capabilities of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft on November 16, 2022. The first flight with a crew will be Artemis II, closely followed by Artemis III that will land crew on the moon in 2025 using a new commercially procured Human Landing System (HLS), chosen to be Starship HLS. They hope to develop a sustainable intereting lunar exploration program starting from 2028.Chinese concepts:The so-called International Lunar Research Station is an interesting idea. In 2020, China proposed the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), a somewhat similar proposal to the Moon Village, with Roscosmos and ESA showing interest. The first steps toward establishing the ILRS will be taken through Phase IV of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, consisting of Chang'e 6, 7, and 8, as well as the Russian missions, Luna 25, 26, and 27. Long-term robotic and short-term crew missions at the ILRS are expected to begin in the early 2030s. Roscosmos signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the creation of the ILRS with CNSA on March 9, 2021. There is really a projected timeline stretching from the 2030s to 2045.Russian concepts:The Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) has planned a fully robotic exciting lunar base called Lunny Poligon. The project was planned for 2020, with an expected completion date of 2037. On March 9, 2021, Russia turned to cooperate with China and signed a memorandum of understanding for the joint construction of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS).","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7997665367365493691.post-8528651521833660455",Space,['Igor B'],"['Chinese', 'United States', 'USA', 'China', 'Russian', 'Moon', 'Russia']",[],"['NASA', 'Roscosmos', 'The Russian Federal Space Agency', 'ESA', 'CNSA', 'Artemis Program', 'Space Launch System', 'The National Aeronautics and Space Administration of United States']","['NASA', 'The First Moon Base', 'a look', 'NASA', 'The First Moon Base', 'The Youtube video', 'A moonbase', 'a facility', 'the surface', 'the Moon', 'human activity', 'the Moon', 'Moonbases', 'robotic or human use', 'both cases', 'lunar habitation facilities', 'A base', 'a step', 'so-called colonization', 'planets', 'Missions', 'the Moon', 'only temporary single-mission bases', 'Tranquility Base', 'some really small permanent installations', 'Plans', 'facilities', 'the Moon', 'that', 'sustained human activity', 'the Moon', 'various space agencies', 'United States concepts', 'USA', 'NASA lunar outpost concepts', 'The USA', 'several attempts', 'some cases', 'lunar outposts', 'the needed missions', 'the upcoming Artemis missions', 'The current Artemis Program', 'The National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'United States', 'NASA', 'an increase', 'the 2020 budget', 'another crewed mission', 'the Moon', 'a sustained presence', 'the Moon', 'NASA', 'plans', 'Commercial Human Lander Awards', 'Artemis Missions', 'the Moon', 'This specific program', 'The Artemis Program', ""NASA's overview"", 'lunar exploration plans', 'This announcement', 'a series', 'complex missions', 'Artemis I', 'the program', 'an uncrewed flight test', 'the capabilities', '(SLS', 'Orion spacecraft', 'November', 'The first flight', 'a crew', 'Artemis', 'Artemis', 'that', 'crew', 'the moon', 'a new commercially procured Human Landing System', 'HLS', 'Starship HLS', 'They', 'a sustainable intereting lunar exploration program', 'The so-called International Lunar Research Station', 'an interesting idea', 'China', 'the International Lunar Research Station', 'ILRS', 'a somewhat similar proposal', 'the Moon Village', 'Roscosmos', 'ESA', 'interest', 'The first steps', 'the ILRS', 'Phase', 'the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program', ""Chang'e"", 'the Russian missions', 'Luna', 'Long-term robotic and short-term crew missions', 'the ILRS', 'the early 2030s', 'Roscosmos', 'a memorandum', 'understanding', 'cooperation', 'the creation', 'the ILRS', 'CNSA', 'March', 'a projected timeline', 'the 2030s', 'concepts', 'The Russian Federal Space Agency', 'Roscosmos', 'a fully robotic exciting lunar base', 'Lunny Poligon', 'The project', 'an expected completion date', 'March', 'Russia', 'China', 'a memorandum', 'understanding', 'the joint construction', 'the International Lunar Research Station', 'ILRS', 'Space']"

1103,World update,Iran is preparing to swiftly increase oil production if US sanctions are lifted.,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 14:31:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2021/06/iran-is-preparing-to-swiftly-increase.html,"Iran is planning a rapid boost in oil output, according to a senior oil ministry official, as discussions between Tehran and six major
nations continue to eliminate US sanctions that have kept the country producing
significantly below capacity since 2018. Iran and the six nations have been in
discussions since April to resurrect a 2015 nuclear agreement that was
terminated three years ago by former US President Donald Trump, reimposing
sanctions.
Most of the country's crude output would be restored within
a month if sanctions are eased, according to Farokh Alikhani, production
manager of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), who spoke to the oil ministry's SHANA website.
Oil output has been restored to pre-sanctions levels at
one-week, one-month, and three-month intervals, according to meticulous
planning.""
 
Washington, on the other hand, stated on Tuesday that even
if the nuclear deal 
However, Washington stated on Tuesday that even if the
nuclear agreement is resurrected, hundreds of US sanctions on Iran will remain
in place. This might imply that fresh Iranian oil supplies will not be
reintroduced into the crude market very soon.
In 2016, Iran emerged from years of economic isolation after
world powers withdrew punishing international sanctions against the Islamic
Republic in exchange for Tehran complying with the 2015 nuclear deal.
 
Tehran's oil exports surged to 2 million barrels per day
(BPD) in 2016 and peaked at 2.8 million BPD until Trump reimposed sanctions in
2018.
 
Iran does not publish current export data, although some
energy monitoring agencies estimate them to be about 700,000 BPD in April and
600,000 in May Alikhani stated that Iran intended to increase output
""to greater than 4 million BPD in the near future.Iran's average daily oil output following the 2015 deal was

1104,World update,Going to bring China over COVID-19 to the International Court of Justice,"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 19:41:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/12/going-to-bring-china-over-covid-19-to.html," Scholars argued that China's actions in connection with
COVID-19 (and the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), especially with the
responsibilities of timing and information communication set out in Articles 6
and 7, violated the International Health Regulations (see, for example, here
and here).


If China had fulfilled these commitments, today's case of
COVID-19 would possibly be exponentially less. This leads another scholar to
declare, ""China can and must be sued for the massive losses it has caused
to the world, and to alert China of the arrival of the lawyers. Nevertheless,
all these authors all share one thing: they do not recognize a legal precedent
to hold China responsible for these infringements by a foreign court or
tribunal.
In compliance with Article 56 of the International Health
Legislation, at least two researchers have pointed out a conflict resolution
mechanism (see here and here), but that mechanism does so only if China accepts
that it is of course, very improbable.
Legal History
However, there is an authority overlooked: Article 75 of the
Constitution of the WHO. Article 75 provides: any issues or disputes pertaining
to or not addressed in talks or the health assembly on the interpretation or
implementation of this Constitution, shall be referred to the ICC...
In fact, the Court itself accepted that the Court's
authority (Armed Practices, Jurisprudence and Admissibility), Decision,
paragraphs of Article 75 of the WHO Constitution. [10]. Moreover, if the Court
viewed Article 75 as Article 22 of the CERD (Ukraine v. Russia, preliminary
objections, decision, para 113), then a State does not proceed to the World
Health Assembly until the State meets the negotiating requirements so that it
may sue China before the Court.
The harder question is how does a State frame its argument
about Chinese actions as an interpreter or application of the WHO Constitution?
It does not seem that the WHO Constitution includes significant
responsibilities under the international health law. Rather the key consideration
is as the name implies, the creation of a legislative system, which discusses
concerns such as membership and institutional structure.

1105,World update,The Big Bloom—How Flowering Plants Changed the World,"Sun, 06 Sep 2020 18:21:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-big-bloomhow-flowering-plants.html," In 1973, sunflowers grew in my father's vegetable garden.
They appeared to sprout spontaneously in a few rows he'd lent to new
California neighbors that year. At the moment, just six years old, these
garish plants first set me off. Such odd and colorful flowers seemed out of
place amid the respectable beans, peppers, spinach, and other vegetables that
we've all grown. Yet eventually, sunflowers' beauty won me over. Their fiery
halos relieved the lush monotonous garden dominated by late summer. I marveled
at birds clinging to shaggy, gold balls, wings fluttering, seed plundering.
That summer, Sunflowers identified flowers for me and changed my outlook.


Flowers have a way to do so. They started transforming the
way the planet looked nearly as soon as they arrived on Earth about 130 million
years ago, during the Cretaceous period. That's comparatively recent in
geological time: if all Earth's past were squeezed into an hour, just the last
90 seconds would be flowering plants. But once they took firm root about 100
million years ago, they soon diversified into an abundance of varieties that
formed much of modern-day flowering plant families.
Today flowering plant species outnumber twenty to one of
ferns and cone-bearing trees or conifers that thrived 200 million years before
the first bloom appeared. As a food source, flowering plants provide the
nourishment essential to our life to us and the rest of the animal world. In
Walter Judd's words, a botanist at Florida University, if not for flowering
plants, we humans wouldn't be here.
From oaks and palms to wildflowers and water lilies, to
miles of cornfields and citrus orchards to the garden of my aunt, flowering
plants have come to dominate the worlds of botany and agriculture. They often
rule over an ethereal world pursued by writers, poets, and ordinary people
finding inspiration, warmth, or the basic joy of seeing a flower.
Before flowering plants emerged, says Dale Russell, a
paleontologist with North Carolina State University and the State Museum of
Natural Sciences, the world was like a Japanese garden: populated by birds,
tortoises, and dragonflies. The planet looked like an English garden after flowering
plants, full of color and abundance, visited by butterflies and honeybees.
Flowers of all sizes flourished amid the greenery.
The seismic transition marks one of the planet's biggest
moments in human history. What made flowering plants rule the world's flora so
fast? What's been their big innovation?
Botanists call angiosperms from the Greek terms for vessel and seed. Unlike conifers in open cones, angiosperms enclose their seeds
in berries. Each fruit contains one or more carpels, hollow chambers that cover
the seeds. Break a tomato in half, for example, and find carpels. These
mechanisms are the distinguishing characteristic of all angiosperms and a key
to the success of this vast plant community, which numbers 235,000 species.
Only when did the first flowering plants emerge? Charles
Darwin pondered the question, and paleobotanists are still finding answers.
Discoveries of fossilized flowers in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North
America provided valuable hints in the 1990s. Simultaneously, the genetics
field introduced a whole new range of methods to scan. Modern paleobotany has
experienced a surge, not unlike the Cretaceous flower eruption itself.
Old-style fossil hunters now compare observations with
shovels and microscopes using genetic analysis to map current plant families
back to their origins. These two researchers groups don't often arrive at the
same birthplace, but both camps agree on why the pursuit is significant.
If we have a clear description of a flowering plant's
nature, says Walter Judd, so we will know information about its form and
function that will help us address any questions: with what species can it be
crossed? What pollinators are effective? This, he claims, moves us towards
increasingly sensitive and efficient farming methods, as well as a clearer
understanding of the broader evolutionary process.
In recent years, Elizabeth Zimmer, a molecular biologist
with the Smithsonian Institution, rethought the process. Zimmer tried to decode
the genealogy of flowering plants by analyzing today's species' DNA. Her work
intensified in the late 1990s during Deep Green, a federally funded project,
designed to promote collaboration among scientists researching plant evolution.
In their pooled results, Zimmer and her colleagues started
searching for classes of plants with similar inherited characteristics, aiming
finally to find a common ancestor for all flowering plants. Amborellaceae, a
genus that comprises only one recognized member, Amborella trichopoda, is the
longest living lineage, stretching back at least 130 million years. Sometimes
described as a living fossil, this small woody plant grows only in New
Caledonia, an island known by botanists for its primeval flora.
But we don't have a 130 million-year-old Amborella, so we
can only imagine if it looks like the range of today. We have fossils from
various extinct tropical species, the oldest found in 130 million-year-old
sediments. These fossils send us our first visible impressions of what looked
like early flowers, indicating they were small and unadorned, without petals.
These no-frill flowers contradict certain conceptions of what constitutes a
flower.
To see what the first primitive angiosperm would look like,
I flew to England and met paleobotanist Chris Hill, formerly at London's
Natural History Museum. Hill drove me south of London through rolling fields to
Smokejacks Brickworks. Smokejacks is a hundred-foot-deep (30-meter-deep) crater
in the earth, as wide as many football fields, providing much more than brick
raw material. The rust-colored clays contained thousands of fossils from 130
million years ago. We marched down the canyon, got down on our hands and knees,
and started digging.


Soon Hill raised some mudstone. He explained it to me,
pointing to an illustration of a tiny stem ending in a primitive flower. The
fossil resembled a single broccoli-picked sprout. The first flower in the world?
More like a flower concept said Hill, who discovered his original fossil in
the early 1990s. He formally called it Bevhalstia Abuja, terms paved from his
closest colleagues' names.
Via my glass, the Bevhalstia fossil looked tiny and straggly,
an unremarkable plant I could see emerging in the water at the edge of a pond
where Hill claims it has grown.
Here's why I think it's a wild flowering herb, Hill said. Bevhalstia
is distinct and unassigned to any existing plant family. So we start by
comparing it to what we know. Any modern aquatic plants' stems follow the same
branching patterns as Bevhalstia and grow tiny flower buds at certain branch
ends. Bevhalstia also bears a striking similarity to a fossil described by
paleobotanists Leo Hickey and Dave Taylor in 1990. The fossil, Australia's
diminutive 120 million-year-old herb, grew leaves that are neither fernlike
nor needlelike. Instead, they are inlaid with veins like typical flowering
plant stems.
More specifically, the specimen of Hickey and Taylor
contains fossilized fruits that once contained seeds, which Hill hopes to find
in Bevhalstia. Both plants lack established petals. Both are more common than
the magnolia, recently disassembled as the oldest tree, though still considered
an ancient legacy. And both, along with a recent discovery from China called
Archaefructus, backed the theory that the very first flowering plants were
plain and unobtrusive.
As other explorers, early angiosperms were overlooked. In a
landscape dominated by conifers and ferns, these botanical pioneers succeeded
in obtaining a toehold in places of natural disruption, such as floodplains and
volcanic zones, adapting rapidly to new conditions. Fossil data leads some
botanists to conclude the first flowering plants were herbaceous, suggesting no
woody sections grew. (New genetic analysis reveals, however, that most ancient
angiosperm lines included both herbaceous and woody plants.) Unlike trees that
take years to mature and bear seed, herbaceous angiosperms survive, reproduce, and die in brief life cycles. This helps them to easily seed new land and maybe
encourage them to grow quicker than their rivals, advantages that could have
improved their diversity.
Although this so-called herbaceous habit may have given them
superiority over slow-growing woody plants, the trump card of angiosperms was
the flower. A flower is essentially an angiosperm's reproduction system. Both
flowers are male and female. Reproduction starts as a flower sheds microscopic
genetic material pollen into the air. These grains finally come to rest on
another flower's stigma, a tiny pollen receptor. In most instances, the stigma
sits atop a stalk-like structure called a style protruding from a flower's
middle. The pollen kernel, moisturized, activates proteins that chemically
determine whether the new plant is genetically compatible. If so, the pollen
grain will germinate and develop a tube down the style and ovary into the ovule
where fertilization occurs and seed starts to form.
Wind casting pollen is a hit-or-miss reproductive method.
While wind pollination suffices for many plant species, direct insect
distribution is much more effective. Undoubtedly, insects started to visit and
pollinate angiosperms until new plants appeared on Earth around 130 million
years ago. But it will be another 30 to 40 million years before flowering
plants attracted insect pollinators' interest by flaunting dazzling petals.
Petals have formed between 90 and 100 million years ago,
said Else Marie Friis, head of paleobotany at the Swedish Natural History
Museum outside Stockholm. And then, very, very little.
A knowledgeable woman with short brown hair and intense
eyes, Friis maintains what many experts say is the most complete collection of
fossils found in one location. The delicate flowers survived death, strangely
enough, due to the heat of long-ago forest fires that burned them into
charcoal.
Friis gave me an 80-million-year-old fossil flower no larger
than at the end of this section. Coated in pure gold for optimum detail under
an electron microscope, it barely seemed a flower. Many researchers ignored
these small, simple flowers, she said, because without the microscope you can't
understand their variety.
So we squatted through her strong magnifier and walked
figuratively through a cretaceous world of small, colourful angiosperms. Friis'
fossilized flowers multiplied hundreds or thousands of times, resemble
wrinkled onion bulbs or radishes. Many have clamped their tiny petals, sealing
carpels within. Others reach full maturity wide open. Dense bunches of pollen
grains cling in gnarled clumps.
Between 70 and 100 million years ago, the number of
flowering plant species on Earth erupted, a phenomenon botanists call it the
great radiation. The spark igniting the eruption, Friis said, was the petal.
Petals provided more variety. This is now commonly known,
Friis said. Once ignored angiosperms were standouts in the field, luring insect
pollinators like never before. Reproduction actually began.


Insect-flowering activity influenced the growth of both
species, a phenomenon called coevolution. In time, flowers developed arresting
patterns, seducing fragrances, and distinctive petals to provide insect
pollinators with landing pads. Nutritious fluid flowers have nectar as a form
of trade product in return for pollen dispersal in the insect benefit package.
Bees, butterflies, and wasps' ancestors became dependent on nectar, and thus
become agents of pollen delivery, unwittingly bearing grains hitched on their
bodies to tiny hairs. These insects may capture and transfer pollen to new
flowers with each visit, enhancing fertilization chances.
Insects were not the only compelled animals to help move
flowering plants to any corner of Earth. Dinosaurs, the world's first movers
and shakers, bulldozed into ancient trees, unintentionally destroying fertile
angiosperm land. They also sowed seeds around land through their digestive
tracts.
By the time the first flowering plant emerged, plant-eating
dinosaurs had been around for a million years, feeding on a diet of ferns,
conifers, and other primordial plants throughout. Dinosaurs lasted for 65
million years and some scientists believe the giant reptiles had plenty of
time to adapt to a new diet that included angiosperms.
Just before dinosaurs died, I believe lots of them were
chowing down on flowering plants, says Kirk Johnson of Nature & Science
Museum Denver. Johnson has discovered several fossils aged 60 to 70 million
from locations throughout the Rocky Mountain region. He deduces from them that
hadrosaurs or duck-billed dinosaurs lived on large angiosperm leaves that had
formed in a warm climatic change just before the Cretaceous period ended.
Referring to sediments that only predate dinosaur extinction, he said, I just
find a few hundred samples of non-flowering plants there, but I collected
35,000 angiosperm specimens. No way the dinosaurs ate these things.
Early angiosperms were low-growing, which better matched
some dinosaurs than others. Brachiosaurs had long necks like giraffes, so they
were poorly equipped to eat new vegetation, says Richard Cifelli, University of
Oklahoma paleontologist. However, ceratopsians and duck-billed dinosaurs were
true mowing devices. Behind those mowers, angiosperms adapted for freshly
cutting ground and spreading.
Dinosaurs abruptly died around 65 million years ago, and
another group of species took their place — the mammals, which greatly
benefited from the variety of angiosperm foods, including seeds, nuts, and
many vegetables. Flowering seeds, in particular, benefited from mammals' seed
dispersal.
Two kingdoms made a handshake, says David Dilcher, a
paleobotanist with Natural History Museum of Florida. I'll feed you and take my
genetic material out.
 
Eventually, mankind changed, and the two realms made another
handshake. Angiosperms fulfilled our need for food by cultivation. In turn, we
took certain species like corn and rice and gave them unprecedented success,
cultivating them in vast fields, deliberately pollinating them, gusto consuming
them. Virtually all non-meat food we consume begins as a flowering plant, while
the foods, milk, and eggs we consume come from grain-fattened animals —
flowers. And wearing cotton is angiosperm.
And aesthetically, angiosperms protect and enrich our lives.
On Valentine's Day, we've come to admire them for their beauty, their scents,
their companionship in a vase, a plant. Some flowers speak an ancient language
of short phrases. For these more sparkling players — orchids, roses, lilies —
the universe grows smaller, crisscrossed every day by jet-setting flowers in
the cargo holds of commercial aircraft.
We aim to supply flowers anywhere in the world within 24
hours of being picked, said Jan Lanning, a senior consultant with the Dutch
Wholesale Commission, the world's ornamental flowers turnstile. The company also
globalized.
On my way home from Friis's Swedish school, I stopped in
the Netherlands, the world's largest exporter of cut flowers. I asked Lanning
to try to describe his chosen job. He leaned with a ready response.
 
Flowers intrigued us as long as we lived. That's an
emotional commodity. Living objects draw people. Smell, light, charm all in a
flower. He grinned at his desk's fragrant lily design. Per Monday a florist
brings this office fresh flowers. It's the luxury required.
Later that day, I spied a group of admirers crowded before a
painting in Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum. I went there and pressed in among
them. Suddenly I saw Sunflowers, one of van Gogh's most famous works. The
flowers hang out of a vase, muddy and disheveled. They took me to my barefoot
youth at the edge of my dad's garden on a wet summer evening alive with
fireflies and cicadas murmur.
The audience went on, with Sunflowers left. My search came
to this surprising end, the first flower I can recall. Would van Gogh raise the
flower to an art form, or would van Gogh's flower harness imagination
immortalize itself in oils and brushstrokes? Flowering plants occupied more
than land. They have profoundly rooted our minds and souls. We know we 're
walking into their world like a museum, and they've been here long before we've
come and maybe stay long after we've left.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3798410824037881193.post-335697871863217630",,['Unknown'],"['New\nCaledonia', 'Rocky Mountain', 'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam',

1106,World update,The Principles Of Gardening,"Sun, 06 Sep 2020 18:07:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-principles-of-gardening.html," Soil: its nature and needs
Soil is the basic element in plant cultivation, but soilless
water growth, with or without gravel or sand, enriched with suitable chemicals
(hydroponics) can be quite effective.
Soil consists of particles, primarily calcium, extracted
from rock dissolution along with organic matter. In particle pore spaces, all
water (containing dissolved salts) and air circulate. The atmosphere contains
more carbon dioxide and less oxygen. Minute living organisms are also found in
immense quantities of soil , making it viable. Plants must cross this area to
access most of their fuel.
The soil must be maintained for fertility (supplying plant
nutrients) and physical health. Nutrients must be supplied and published in
plant-available ways. Plant growth requires sixteen elements. Three of these,
fuel, oxygen, and hydrogen, are supplied by water and air; the other 13 by soil.
The elements required in relatively large quantities are called major elements:
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur.
Small-scale minerals are considered trace elements: iron, boron, manganese,
zinc, molybdenum, copper, and chlorine.
Soils can be loosely classified into three primary
categories based on horticultural utility, but many areas contain a
combination.
Clays
Clays, where particles are very small, are considered soft
soils in horticulture because it's hard to turn them over with a spade. They
can be very nutritious but tend to lack adequate drainage, keeping their water
strongly adhered to the soil particles; thus, they can not be worked when wet,
and under pressure they tend to compress tightly, pushing the air out. They
seem to get tough during drought and even grow large cracks so they can't
function satisfactorily. Clay soils should be lightened by as much hummus as
possible. Humus may be any decayed organic matter, such as waste, leaf mold,
or compost made from kitchen scraps and grass cutting.
Sands and gravels
Sands and gravel are analogous to clay. Soil particles are
huge, and soils are considered light because they are easy to work and turn in
almost any temperature. However, their water-holding capacity is very poor,
they tend to dry out easily. They are ""hungry"" soils that need lots of
manures, humus, and fertilizers to keep them productive.
Peats and heaths
Peats and heaths are typically very acidic and drained. They
result in conditions preventing the full breakdown of old vegetable matter into
humus, usually due to insufficient aeration and excess bog water. Most peat is
extracted from the rotting roots of sphagnum moss, suitable for garden
mulching. A heat soil is usually less fertile, consisting of a large mixture of
sand and peat, and tends to be very poor in mineral and water-retaining
ability.
The best garden soil is a medium loam composed of a mixture
of clay and sand, moderately rich in humus and readily treated, and when dry,
not producing large clods. Soil consistency is important as a porous, properly
tilled soil provides a medium through which roots can penetrate quickly and
easily. Another important factor in soils is acidity or alkalinity.
Soil alkalinity is typically extracted from free calcium or
equivalent alkaline salt. Soil reaction may be changed. It can become more alkaline
by adding lime to one of the organic salts, of which calcium is better. Acidity
can be improved by adding hydrogen as sulfur compounds such as ammonia
sulfate or superphosphate.
Feeding: fertilizing and watering
Maximum return can only be achieved from the soil with ample
supply of elements necessary for plant growth, combined with sufficient
moisture to dissolve and absorb them through plant fur.
Farmyard manure or garden compost treatment will meet many
of these requirements. Since manure and compost are scarce in urban areas,
mineral fertilizers and organics are also required. Soil is such a complex
material that all fertilizers must be used in moderation and balance, based on
the soil shortages and the needs of the individual crop.
Different crops require different fertilizers. Manures are
usually best dug into the ground in a temperate climate in autumn, but can also
be used as mulches in spring to control weeds. Mulch is a surface layer of
organic matter that helps grow, maintain moisture, and control weeds. Black
polyethylene sheeting is now widely used for all mulching except feeding.
The watering of freshly planted plants during drought cycles is
an important gardening chore. Deep, detailed watering — not just sprinkling the
soil surface — can result in dramatically improved development. Water is
essential in itself, but it also provides plants with minerals in solution, the
only plant-usable type. About one inch of water added to the soil surface each
week will percolate down about six inches; this is insufficient food for many
herbaceous garden plants, and small trees and shrubs need more. Proper watering
once a week enables deep root penetration, allowing plants to withstand dry
surface conditions.
Drainage
Drainage is another significant water conservation aspect.
All plants require water, but the quantity required varies. If plants are
pressured to consume more than they need, a drowning process occurs. Symptoms
are more commonly observed in overwatered pot plants but are often visible to
a seasoned eye in poorly drained garden corners. Roots require both air and
water to carry the requisite oxygen to the surface.
Buried earthenware piping is popular in large private
gardens and commercial gardens. Drainage can be easily accomplished in smaller
gardens by using sumps, i.e. holes drilled to about four feet in affected
areas. The sump's bottom half is packed with stones to drain wastewater. Such
initiatives can significantly boost a garden's capacity and workability.
 
Protecting plants
Many plants have specific cold resistance, in which they are
destroyed. Many tropical or subtropical plants can not tolerate frost and are
killed at temperatures below 32 ° F ( 0 ° C). They're called frost-tender.
Others, called half-hardy, can tolerate certain frost degrees. Luckily, many of
the better garden plants are fully hardy, a trait also promoted by diligent
selection, and would be able to survive any low temperatures in temperate
regions.
Various precautions may be taken to prevent ice, from simple
ones suitable for smaller gardens to complex coverings used to preserve
important horticultural crops. Removing weeds that cover the soil increases the
heat generated during the day. Well-drained, less prone soil. Any frosty wind
cover increases insulation capability. The easiest method of protection is to
hold moist air around the plant. This may be a mulch (leaves, dirt, ashes)
applied over the winter crown of a somewhat tender plant or a leaf-shedding
cover (not as attractive for evergreens that use their leaves all year round).
Glass structures like greenhouses or outdoor frames may
provide extra plant protection. These systems can be heated and temperature
controlled to some degree by a thermostat. Thus, in temperate areas, orchids
and other tropical plants may be grown to bloom in the winter, causing them to
bloom earlier than their normal season due to the higher temperature.
Greenhouses are classified by gardeners into four rough
categories : ( 1) a cold house, where there is no external heating and which is
ideal only for plants that are not destroyed by a few degrees of frost (such as
alpine or potted bulbous plants). Combining solar heat and wind safety would
keep such a house appreciably colder than outside air. (2) Coolhouse where
minimum temperature stands at 45 ° F (7 ° C). Many greenhouses of amateurs fall
into this range, and many plants can be grown in them. (3) Take a look at it.
The intermediate home, where the minimum temperature is held at
55 or 60 ° F (13 or 16 ° C) and ideal for a wide variety of orchids. (4) The
hothouse or stove house where the minimum temperature is above 60 ° F (16 ° C)
and where tropical plants such as anthuriums and cattleyas (orchid genus) can
be grown.
Training and pruning
Training, plant orientation in space, is accomplished
through techniques that guide plant growth form, scale, and direction. Using
supports on which plants can be stretched, twisted, or fastened may be
achieved. Pruning is undertaken for other purposes: to preserve height, to
promote fruiting in orchard trees, or to enhance the appearance of ornamental
trees and shrubs. It's one of the major horticultural disciplines.
Where trees and shrubs are left to grow naturally, they
sometimes become too large for garden space. They can even grow lanky and weak,
and grow soon extinct. Where a branch or shoot is removed, a variety of young
shoots from below the removed are always produced, and these are likely to
flower freer than older trees. Especially when pruned annually, fruit trees
also produce finer quality, greater scale, more disease-free, and better color.
The two simple cut-offs are named going back and thinning out.
Heading back consists of cutting back a branch's terminal
section to a bud; thinning-out is the complete removal of a branch to a lateral or
main trunk. Moving back, typically accompanied by lateral bud break stimulation
below the split, produces a bushy, compact plant suitable for a hedgerow which
is often used to rejuvenate shrubs that have grown too large or flower
poorly. Thinning out, which allows the remaining terminals to grow longer by
growing lateral branches, tends to open the plant, creating a longer plant. In
general, pruning, done when the plant is young, overlooks the need for dramatic
and dangerous remedial pruning of a huge, aged, or misshapen bush or tree.
Special spatial arrangements can increase light use, promote
harvesting or disease control, or improve efficiency and efficiency. Training
and pruning are an important aspect of fruit growth during the plant's life.
In the formative years, special attention is given to obtaining the desired shape
and structure. The secret to training is the point from which divisions are created.
In the center-leader training system, the trunk forms a central axis with
branches laterally up and down and across the stem. In the open-center or vase
system, the main stem is terminated and development is pushed into a variety
of branches emerging at the top of the tree.
An intermediate structure is called modified-leader. Plants
are conditioned in espalier systems to expand flat over wire or trellis. Proper
suppliers are particularly desirable as ornamentals. Espaliers in conjunction
with dwarfing rootstocks make high-density orchards that are highly profitable
per-unit-based, with fruits near to the ground for fast harvesting. The device
requires comprehensive pruning annually.
There are physiological reactions to exercise and pruning.
Plant orientation can have a pronounced impact on growth and fruiting. Thus,
fruit trees planted at an inclined angle are dwarfed and flowered earlier;
training branches in a horizontal position have the same effect. This result is
caused automatically when a heavy load twists a leg. Pruning's key results are
accomplished by modifying root – shoot equilibrium.
Thus, a vegetative growth explosion usually happens after
intensive pruning. Severely pruned plants, particularly in the juvenile growth
stage, appear to remain vegetative. Similarly, root pruning delays vegetative
growth facilitates flowering.
Training plants in artificial ways for ornamental uses is
called topiary. In the Roman and Renaissance periods, when imaginative topiary was
in high demand, plants were raised in strange and spectacular ways such as
beasts, ships, and façades. Perhaps more modestly, informal gardens, hedges, and shrubs are also educated in geometric designs.
Another intense method of training is Japanese bonsai art,
making dwarfed potted trees by mixing pruning (both roots and tops) and
restricted diet. Live trees over 100 years old and just a few feet high are
grown in unique containers that mimic the natural world.
Propagation
New plants are developed by seed or division techniques,
cutting, grafting, budding, or layering. For the average gardener, propagation
is a relatively basic but fascinating method generally used to provide more
varieties of favorite plants as part of exchanges with other gardeners or as wise protection against winter losses. (See horticulture for a full explanation
of propagation and breeding processes.)
Cutting transmission is a common practise. Young shoots of the
current season are typically rooting most effective. Roses are usually
propagated by budding, inserting a bud from the desired rose into the rootstock
(that part of the plant tissue from which a root can form) just above ground
level. Fruit trees are typically propagated by layering, where a young shoot is
trapped in the earth with the end bent upward nearly at right angles; the lower
side of the wood just before the twist is wounded to cause rooting. If this
happens, the parent divides the plate.

1107,World update,Puberty can fix stress after adversity early in life,"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:29:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/08/puberty-can-fix-stress-after-adversity.html," A researcher puts stickers on a lazy Susan under some
plastic cups, then offers a whirl. A preschooler must find hidden stickers when
the spinning ends. Some kids remember where the stickers are, but some have to
search each cup.
The game measures working memory, one of the group of
behavioral abilities known as executive control that can be compromised in
early-life trauma-facing adolescents.
Adversity wreaks havoc, and from there you have a mechanism
that reacts differently, says Megan Gunnar, a developmental psychobiologist at
Minnesota University in Minneapolis who spent two decades researching the
effects of early-life adversity in adopted kids. This work focuses on acute
hardship, such as being orphaned, rather than regular struggles, which may
teach valuable resilience.

An infancy marked by deprivation, neglect or violence may
also change the neuroendocrine system governing how the body reacts to stress.
Stress response issues will put children on a road to developmental challenges
along with increased risk of adhd, diabetes, and a host of other health
concerns.
Yet new reports indicate that a daunting future might not be
necessary. As Gunnar and others have demonstrated, disrupted stress responses
can revert to normal during puberty, making it easier to remove imbalances
produced by early trauma. Research is encouraging a new understanding of
puberty as an opportunity — a chance for adults with a weak beginning to change
their physiological responses to stress.
A sense of safety
When the brain perceives a threat — even a fleeting one,
such as a painful test or a high-stakes competition — levels of hormone
adrenaline shot up , causing the ""fight-or - flight"" reflex. Breathing
and pace ascend. Palms hot. See and sharpen senses. The brain sends chemical
messengers to activate adrenal glands near the kidneys to release cortisol.
Cortisol transfers sugars to blood for quick energy. In a
fight-or - flight case, the hormone often delays metabolism, immune responses,
development and other functions considered non-essential.
The fight-or - flight response stops when the danger
disappears, at least in a person whose stress response functions as it should.
Levels of adrenaline and cortisol drops, pulse rate slows, and other processes
continue business as normal.
When Gunnar began her doctoral study in the 1970s ,
researchers already figured out main players in the stress response. Involved
neuroendocrine impulses form the HPA axis, short for
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal. When rodents and monkeys face early difficulty,
the HPA axis is knocked off-kilter. When techniques were possible to quantify
cortisol from saliva samples — rather than extracting blood or urine — Gunnar
set out to research how the HPA axis affects human brain and conduct.
From mid-1980s studies with newborn babies, Gunnar found
that having a stable parent relationship is crucial for a healthy
neuroendocrine system and helps babies cope with challenging conditions such as
getting immunizations. You can go to the hospital as a infant and have a huge
shot in one leg and the other leg, and you're tearing off your back ... but it
doesn't take off, says Gunnar. But if babies are separated from their parents
for even a few minutes, their HPA axis rockets up like a missile.
Gunnar wonders what happens if the long-term feeling of
protection is broken. She attempted to research neglected and deprived
children, but distinguishing the consequences of early deprivation from later
problems is not straightforward. ""The way you start life seems to
continue,"" says Gunnar. A US-published paper last November. Centers on
Disease Control and Prevention refers to the long-term effects of smoking,
drinking excessively, dropping out of high school and having heart disease and a
host of other health problems relative to their peers.
A mid-1990s trip put Gunnar on a new direction to address
the troublesome study issue. She went to an orphanage in eastern Romania with a
study team, where children were living in overcrowded, barbaric circumstances.
You step into these wards, and immediately you're mobbed by kids shouting 'Mom,
Mom, Mom' ... stretching their arms to get hold, says Gunnar, who at the time
had two school-age sons. It was bad. I just tried to get them home.
What she carried back to Minnesota was a series of small
vials, each holding a saliva sample from a 2- or 3-year-old orphan. To her
dismay, cortisol levels in kids — the end result of the neuroendocrine cascade
— were smaller than the normal people. The study provided a window on long-term
parental neglect effects on stress responses.
Adoptee struggles
To recognise the impact of early adversity, Gunnar wanted
kids who began out in misery but migrated to stable, nurturing environments
after infancy. Such kids will be the perfect model for all early adversity
animal experiments, she thought. It dawned that this community exists: orphans
adopted.
Gunnar shared her proposal with employees of the Minnesota
Human Services Department's adoption team. With support and funds from the
agency, she surveyed Minnesota parents who had adopted children abroad in the
1990s, encouraging families to enter a university registry and engage in
research.
 
Many research parents had found early that their adoptive
children had behavioural issues. And when the kids came to the university lab
for problem-solving and sorting exercises, including the lazy Susan challenge
and the successful marshmallow test of delayed gratification, the kids
struggled with treatment and self-regulation.
Like Romanian orphans, these kids had lower amounts of
cortisol than children who had no behavioural issues. Gunnar speculates that in
the face of prolonged suffering, which has the potential to promote excessively
high levels of cortisol, a poor stress response — that is, generating less
cortisol — could be the way nature protects the brain and body.
Teen-time shift
Adopted children who grew up with early-life abuse (gray
curve) before puberty had blunted stress responses compared to children with
birth parents (blue curve). Before, after and after a challenging mission, the
adopted kids showed regular cortisol levels. Saliva was extracted 20 minutes
before the mission, 5, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes after the assignment.
Researchers translated data to a logarithmic scale, displaying negative
figures. Cortisol amounts range between 0 and 1 microgram per deciliter.
Studying adoptees over time, she noticed that
care-probleming preschoolers with low cortisol often reached kindergarten. A
blunted stress response continued in middle childhood, even after an average
seven or eight years in a safe care home.
 
That was disheartening, says Russell Romeo, Barnard College
psychobiologist in New York City. We 'd always figured they would start
recalibrating their stress reactivity once they get out of stressful
circumstances.
 
But Romeo 's study in the mid-2000s gave Gunnar cause to believe
she wanted to look deeper into the direction of children's lives.High time for change

Romeo examined rats to see how depression influences teenage
and adult brains differently. In one series of tests, he exposed adult rats and
prepubescent rats to acute stress — 30 minutes stuck inside a wire mesh jar —
and reported their corticosterone levels (cortisol rat version) before, during
and after confinement. Both groups developed similar hormone spikes when
stressed, but levels in juvenile rats took much longer to normalize.
When Romeo studied how animals responded to long stress
periods—30 minutes of seven-day restriction per day — the behavior was
different. Since freeing the animals from the chains, tension hormones spiked
higher in young rats than in adults. Yet rats near puberty returned to baseline
quicker than older males. Taken together, research by Romeo proposed
neuroendocrine stress responses were formed during adolescence to appear
differently in adulthood.
In earlier studies , researchers at McGill University in
Montreal found that transferring teenage rats to enriched environments — larger
cages with more toys and cagemates — could reset stress mechanisms that
early-life deprivation had thrown out of whack.
 
Ses results inspired Gunnar. Maybe I'd look into puberty,
she figured. It may be recalibrating time.
Closer to normal
During traumatic behavior (such as speaking), saliva
cortisol levels increased briefly and returned to usual among those children
who stayed with their biological parents. Children adopted from childhood in an
orphanage (an early-life trauma) had blunted cortisol responses at stages 1 to
2 of puberty. Yet at the rear end of puberty, stages 4 and 5, accepted
standardized infant stress responses.
Thus, her team welcomed 280 7- to 14-year-olds—122
youngsters adopted from organizations and 158 from social comparable maternal
families — to the laboratory to perform two challenging tasks. One was
demanding theoretical arithmetic. For the second assignment, each pupil
practiced a five-minute speech announcing a new student class. Children were
told their voice, presented in front of a video camera and mirror, would be
judged. Some kids talked enthusiastically, others seemed anxious. We had one
break into laughter, Gunnar says. So we're not torturing them. If we find they
're too anxious, we 're making them leave.
Before and during each child's speech and math activities,
researchers gathered saliva samples to test cortisol levels. The pubertal
status of the participants was measured on a 1-to-5 scale: stage 1 meant no
visible body modifications and stage 5 meant full sexual maturation.
Both early puberty kids (stages 1–2), adoptive kids had
blunted cortisol levels before and after the activities similar to kids living
with their biological parents. This finding validated Gunnar 's previous
pre-school-age foreign adoption study. Cortisol trends in late puberty group
(stages 4–5) appeared identical for adopted and unadopted adolescents.
In order to confirm HPA recalibration, instead of simply
contrasting across age groups, Gunnar and colleagues took participants for the
same assessments one and two years later, for a total of three annual sessions.
Matthew Duggan, a Long Beach, California psychiatrist
working in childhood and puberty, is inspired by results and feels they could
relate to a wide variety of children who have difficulty controlling their
feelings and communicating with others when parents neglected or overlooked
them early in life. There may be a chance ... where things may change, Duggan
says. And we have some evidence to show that this is a probability at biological
stage. That's very optimistic for me.
Duggan suggests Gunnar 's study would have been even more
beneficial if it had measured the change in behavior of participants — for
example, by questioning parents , teachers, or teenagers themselves.
How can puberty combine better treatment and help to reshape
neuroendocrine stress responses? Romeo speculates that stems from the fact that
the hypothalamus and other brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, that
regulate our stress reactions are among the regions that rewire and establish
associations throughout adolescence.
It's impossible to tell whether these changes in the stress
response will actually benefit a young person, Gunnar says. Mental wellbeing
and endurance arise from an ever-changing mix of genes and social experiences —
some of which early bring the body awry. But puberty may probably remove any
harm, her research reveals. Gunnar and others intend to discover more of the
fundamental reboot biology.

1108,World update,"Ancient arms race sharpened our immune system, which still left us weak","Sat, 25 Jul 2020 23:09:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/07/ancient-arms-race-sharpened-our-immune.html,"


At a recent conference held on the evolution of infectious
diseases, pathologist Nissi Varki, University of California, San Diego (UCSD),
observed that humans suffer from a long list of fatal diseases — including
typhoid fever, cholera, mumps, whooping cough, measles, smallpox, polio, and
gonorrhea — that don't bother chimpanzees and most other mammals.

Both these bacteria follow the same mechanism to get into
our cells: they target sugar molecules called sialic acids. Hundreds of
millions of these sugars study the outer surface of any cell in the human body
— and human sialic acids differ from apes.

Varki and an international research team have now studied
how nature could have struggled to develop new defenses after molecular
instability appeared in our distant ancestors. Through studying current human
genomes and ancient DNA from our extinct ancestors, Neanderthals and
Denisovans, the researchers found an evolutionary explosion of our immune cells
that happened at least 600,000 years ago in an ancestor of all three human
forms.

As researchers write in Genome Biology and Evolution's current problem, these genetic modifications may have sharpened the body's
defenses against the pathogens emerging to target sialic acids — but produced
new vulnerabilities. In an additional irony, they say, the characteristic
sialic acids of humans were once a defense against disease.

Evolutionary saga is a dramatic example of human-microbe
rivalry, says microbiologist Christine Szymanski of Georgia University, Athens,
who is not a co-author. ""This gives a human perspective on how to keep
changing to keep pace.""

The domain for this biological arms race is glycocalyx, a
sugar-coating that covers the cells' outer membrane. It consists of a bacterial
forest from the cell membrane. Sialic acids are at the tip of the strongest
roots, sugar chains or glycans, embedded lower in the membrane of fats and
proteins.

Despite their importance and number, sialic acids are
typically the first molecules to meet invading pathogens. One form of sialic acid,
N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), coats human cells. Yet apes and other humans
also bear another, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc).

According to multiple molecular clock methods, a mutation in
the CMAH gene on chromosome six made it impossible for human ancestors to
produce Neu5Gc anymore; instead, they made more of another sialic acid, Neu5Ac.
""We now learn we have an ancient full structure of the surface of human
cells,"" says UCSD evolutionary biologist Pascal Gagneux, co-author of the
new article. Birds, rats, ferrets, and New World monkeys made the same genetic
transition independently.

The move likely emerged as a defense against malaria, says
UCSD physicist-scientist Ajit Varki, paper's senior author and Nissi Varki 's
husband. Malarial parasites that infect chimpanzees will no longer bind our red
blood cells with altered sialic acids.

Yet it became a vulnerability over the next million years or
so, as Neu5Ac became a preferred gateway for a flurry of other pathogens. At
the symposium on infectious disease organized by UCSD's Anthropogeny Academic
Research and Training Center, researchers described how multiple diseases
evolved to use Neu5Ac to enter cells or evade immune cells.

Coronaviruses are no different. ""Many coronaviruses
infect cells in two stages — first, by establishing abundant sialic acids as
binding sites to obtain

A foothold, and then higher-affinity protein receptors like
ACE2, ""says Ajit Varki. ""Think of it as an initial handshake or the presentation needed before a date can be demanded."" Two preprints say the
novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, also docks with sialic acids before binding to
human cells with the ACE2 receptor.

In previous research, Ajit Varki and Gagneux proposed cell
structure and the lack of Neu5Gc may have led to the emergence of a new
species in our Homo genus. When a woman with only Neu5Ac sialic acids matted
with a man who also expressed Neu5Gc, she may have denied the man's sperm or
the fetus resulted from it.

More than 2 million years ago, researchers hypothesized,
this reproductive barrier may have helped split homo populations into separate
groups.

But the change in sialic acid also sparked a new arms race
between pathogens and our ancestors. Researchers scanned DNA for immune genes
in six Neanderthals, two Denisovans, and 1000 humans in the latest research and
even looked at hundreds of chimps, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. We found
evolutionary modifications that ""markedly changed"" one family of
proteins—sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins, or Siglecs—usually
sitting on human immune cells' surface and detecting sialic acids.

Siglecs are molecular sentries: they check sialic acids to
see if they are common body components or alien invaders. When Siglecs find
damaged or absent sialic acids, they signal immune cells to activate, rousing
an aggressive force to strike foreign invaders or clean damaged cells. When,
then, sialic acids tend to be natural components of our own bodies, other,
inhibitory Siglecs turn down immune responses to prevent targeting our own tissues
(see graph above).

Researchers reported functional variations in eight out of
13 Siglecs genomic DNA expressed in a CD33 gene cluster on chromosome 19 in
humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. This hot spot in evolution happened only
invariants in Siglec genes, not in adjacent chromosome genes, indicating that
natural selection favored these changes, possibly because they helped combat
pathogens attacking Neu5Ac.
Apes didn't show these changes, says first
author Naazneen Khan, an evolutionary biologist at Kentucky University.

1109,World update,Zheng Yanxiong China appoints Hong Kong's hard-line security chief,"Fri, 03 Jul 2020 18:31:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/07/zheng-yanxiong-china-appoints-hong.html,"



China named a hard-line figure to lead Hong Kong 's newsecurity agency.

Zheng Yanxiong is best known for his role in dealing with a
land dispute protest in Wukan, southern China.

The new organization, responding directly to Beijing, is set
up in Hong Kong this week to implement a draconian security law.

Regulation critics claim it erodes territorial freedoms.

With up to life in prison, the law opposes secession,
subversion and terrorism.

Many leading pro-democracy activists have abandoned their
positions and one of them, once student leader and local legislator Nathan Law,
has fled the region.

Separately, one of ten people arrested during demonstrations
on Wednesday has been the first to be convicted under the new legislation. Hundreds
were arrested in clashes.

The motorcyclist was charged with promoting secession and
extremism, accused of riding into a group of police while holding a banner
calling for Hong Kong 's independence.

Beijing has rejected criticism of the rule, saying the sort
of pro-democracy demonstrations seen in Hong Kong during most of 2019 must be
stopped.



In 1997, Britain handed over Hong Kong 's sovereignty to
China and other privileges under the ""one country, two systems""
arrangement were to be guaranteed for at least 50 years.

·        
How people fear Hong Kong's new law

·        
Minutes after a new law, voices leave

Yet China has dismissed UK and other Western nations'
allegations that it violates such assurances as interference in its domestic
affairs.

What do China 's latest appointees know?

Mr Zheng's most recent senior job in southern Guangdong
province was as secretary general of the Communist Party committee.



But he is best known as party boss in Shanwei, Guangdong,
when a protest broke out in 2011 by villagers in Wukan seeking compensation for
land requisitioned by the government.

He blamed villagers for complaining about their problems
to  a few rotten international media outlets
instead of the government.

Such media outlets will only be happy when our socialist
county falls apart, he said on local TV.

The violence led the government to a unprecedented compromise,
with the direct election of a central official. Five years later, however, he
was arrested for graft and quashed demonstrations.



Although Mr. Zheng was no longer in his position in Shanxei,
he was still a senior official in Guangdong.



Certain Beijing appointments include Luo Huining, who is
Hong Kong's chief executive advisor on the new security legislation.

Mr Luo currently heads the liaison office in Beijing.
Veteran official Eric Chan will head the national security commission of the
territory.

You must learn about a Guangdong village named Wukan to
learn Zheng Yanxiong.

In 2011, disaffected residents violently ousted local
government officials, accusing them of stealing their property in a series of crooked
developer transactions.

A protest emerged and residents were granted the right to
elect their own council as part of a negotiated deal to defuse tensions. This
was China's grassroots political exception.

Five years later, the people, furious that no money was paid
for the confiscated property, began marching in the streets again. The crisis
worsened after the authorities took away their elected leader on what are
considered to be trumped up allegations.

In control of their own affairs, the motivated locals
believed they could achieve justice. But when this uprising fed up with the
Communist Party, senior cadre Zheng Yanxiong and others had to deal with it.
Hundreds of riot police were directed to seize power, mass arrests and disrupt
the Wukan trial.

This Cantonese-speaking enforcer has since risen up the
ranks with a reputation for doing whatever is required. He is now in charge of
a new intelligence agency in Hong Kong that operates without any legal
constraints and which no other agencies can enter.

What's the protection law?

The law is wide-ranging, promoting distrust of centralgovernment in China and national government crimes in Hong Kong.

This also allows closed-door hearings, wire-tapping suspects
and the opportunity for prosecution on the Chinese mainland.

Acts can be called terrorism, like destroying public transit
infrastructure-which also happened during the 2019 protests.



There are also questions about online privacy, as internet
providers can need to turn over data if demanded by police.

What was the overseas reaction?

US lawmakers overwhelmingly supported new Hong Kong-related
restrictions, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claiming that the legislation
amounted to a brutal, sweeping crackdown on the Hong Kong people to undermine the
freedoms they were promised.

Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the
legislation was a simple and serious violation of the joint Sino-British
declaration of 1985.

In the wake of the implementation of the law, the UK
provided residency and potential citizenship to up to three million Hong
Kongers.

Many others have raised deep concerns. Australia announced
it was considering giving Hong Kongers safe haven like the UK.

China replied by saying Hong Kong is none of your business.

Cuba adopted the rule at the UN Human Rights Council on
behalf of 53 countries.

1110,World update,Envy separates society,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:07:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/06/envy-separates-society.html,"


Envyalters individual behavior and, consequently, strategies of a person in
characteristic ways. Due to changed behavior, two separate social classes
arise. Differences in cement class history and education are widely known. It
is not clear when and under what circumstances individual psychological forces
will separate and separate an initially homogeneous social group. Claudius
Gros, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Goethe,
investigated this issue mathematically precisely using game theory methods which
means that everyone optimizes their success by predetermined rules.


I wanted to find out if social differences can emerge alone
if no one starts with advantages – that is, if all actors have the same skills
and opportunities, ""explains the physicist.

The study is based on the assumption that things are coveted
but limited in every society, such as jobs, social contacts, and power positions.
If the top position is already occupied, an inequality is created and somebody
must accept the second-best job, but not a social division. Using mathematical
calculations, Gros was able to demonstrate that envy arising from the need to
compare with others alters individual behavior and, consequently, the
strategies of agents in characteristic ways. This changed behavior produces two
strictly separate social classes.

Game theory provides many participants with the mathematical
resources required to model decision situations, as in Gros' analysis. In
general, constellations where each actor's decision strategies influence each
other are particularly revealing. The individual's success then depends not
only on his or her own actions, but also on the actions of others, typical of
economic and social contexts. Game theory is deeply rooted in the economy.



Game theory's stability condition, the ""Nash
equilibrium"" is a term developed by John Forbes Nash in his 1950
dissertation, using the example of poker players. It states that no player has
anything to gain by changing their strategy if the other players do not change
theirs either. An individual tries new behavior patterns only if there is
potential gain. Because this causal chain often relates to evolutionary
processes, evolutionary and behavioral sciences often rely on game-theoretical
models, e.g. when studying animal behaviors such as bird migratory flight
routes or their nesting site rivalry.

Also in an envy-induced class society, Gros says, there's no
motivation for a person to change their strategy. So it's Nash stable. In the
divided envy society, there is a marked income difference between the upper and
lower class that is the same for all members of each social class. According to
Gros, it is typical for the members of the lower class to spend their time on a
series of different activities.

However, upper-class members focus on one task, i.e. pursue
a ""pure strategy."" It is also striking that the upper class can
choose between different options while the lower class has only one mixed
strategy. And the upper class is individualistic, while the crowd loses agents
in the lower class, the physicist sums up.




Whether an agent lands in the upper or lower class is
essentially a mistake in Claudius Gros' model. It's decided by competition
dynamics, not origin. Gros developed a new theoretical model for his study, the
""shopping trouble model,"" and developed a precise analytical
solution. He derives from it that an envy-induced class society possesses features
deemed universal in complex system theory. As a result, class society is to
some extent beyond political control.




Political decision-makers lose much of their power when
society unexpectedly divides into social groups. Furthermore, Gros' model shows
that envy has a stronger effect when competition for limited resources is
stronger. ""This theoretical game insight could be central. Even a 'ideal
society' can not be sustained stably in the long-term, which ultimately makes
the striving for a communist society seem unrealistic, ""the scientist
remarks.

Final words

Envy, the inclination to compare rewards, can be expected to
unfold when pay-off disparities are generated in competitive societies. It is
shown that increasing envy levels inevitably lead to self-induced separation
into lower and upper classes. Class stratification is Nash stable and strict,
with class members receiving identical rewards. Upper-class agents just play
single tactics, all lower-class agents the same mixed strategy. The fraction of
upper-class agents gradually decreases with greater envy levels until a single
upper-class agent remains.

Numerical simulations and a complete analysis of a basic
reference model, the shopping trouble model, are presented. Class-stratified
society's properties are universal and only indirectly controllable through the
underlying utility function, implying that class-stratified societies are
intrinsically resistant to political control. Implications are discussed for
human communities. Envy effects are intensified as cultures become more
competitive.

      1.   Fasting intermittently2.    Tracking and exercising3.    Eat attentively4.    Eat breakfast protein5.    Reducing sugar and processed carbohydrates6.    Eat plenty of fiber7.    Balancing intestinal bacteria8.    A good night's sleep9.    Manage your stress levels





Fasting intermittently





       Alternate Day Fasting (ADF): Fast daily and eat
normally on non-fasting days. The                    modified    version involves eating just 25-30%
of the body's energy needs on fasting days.
      Diet 5:2: Fast on 2 every 7 days. Eat 500–600
calories on fasts.
         Method 16/8: Fast 16 hours, eat only during an
8-hour window. For most people, the 8-              hour      window would be around 8 p.m. A
research on this approach showed eating over a        short time resulted in
participants consuming fewer calories and losing weight.









Adopt a healthy eating pattern on
non-fasting days and avoid over-eating.

Tracking and exercising



If anyone decides to lose weight, they will know what they
eat and drink every day. The most effective way to do this is to log every item
they consume in a journal or online food tracker.

Researchers reported 3.7 billion health device downloads by
year-end in 2017. Among the most common were diet apps, physical activity, and
weight loss. This is not without justification, as measuring progress on
physical activity and weight loss can be an efficient way to control weight.

One study found that consistent physical
activity tracking helped the weight loss. Meanwhile, a review study found a positive correlation between weight loss and intake and exercise monitoring
frequency. Even a pedometer-like gadget can be a useful weight-loss tool



Eat attentively



Mindful eating is a practice where people watch how and
where they eat food. This practice can allow people to enjoy their food and
maintain a healthy weight.



As most people lead busy lives, they tend to eat quickly on
the run, in the car, at their desks and watch TV. As a result, many people
barely know the food they eat.

Mindful eating techniques include:

·        
Sitting down at a table, preferably: pay
attention to food and enjoy the experience.

·        
Take time to chew and savor the meal. This technique helps with weight loss as it gives a person's brain sufficient time
to recognize the signals they are full, which can help prevent over-eating.

·        
Making considered food choices: Choose foods
that are full of nutrients and those that satisfy for hours, not minutes.

Eat breakfast protein


Protein can adjust appetite hormones to help people feel
full. This is mainly due to decreased hunger hormone ghrelin and increased
satiety hormones peptide YY, GLP-1, and cholecystokinin.

Young adult research has also shown that the hormonaleffects of eating a high-protein breakfast will last many hours.



Good breakfast options include eggs, oats, nut and seed
butters, quinoa porridge, sardines and chia seed pudding.

Reducing sugar and processed
carbohydrates



The Western diet is increasingly high in added sugars, and
this has definite links to obesity, even when sugar occurs in food rather than
beverages.



Refined carbohydrates are highly processed foods, no longer
containing fiber and other nutrients. These include rice, bread and pasta.

These foods quickly digest and quickly convert to glucose.



Excess glucose enters the blood and causes hormone insulin,
promoting fat storage in adipose tissue. This leads to gaining weight.

Wherever possible, people should swap processed and sugar
foods for healthier options. Good swaps include:

·        
Full-grain rice, bread and pasta instead of
white

·        
Meat, nuts and seeds instead of snacks

·        
Herbal teas and fruit-infused juice instead of
soda

·        
Water / milk smoothies instead of fruit juice

Eat plenty of fiber



Dietary fiber identifies carbohydrates that can not be
digested in the small intestine, unlike sugar and starch. Having plenty of
fiber in the diet can increase fullness, potentially leading to weight loss.





Fiber-rich foods are:

Full-grain
cereals, whole-grain pasta, whole-grain bread, spinach, barley and rye



·        
Meat, vegetables

·        
Peas, beans, seeds

·        
Nuts, seeds
        Balancing intestinal bacteria

One emerging research area focuses on bacteria's role in
weight management in the gut.

The human gut hosts a vast number of microorganisms, including
about 37 trillion bacteria.

Every person has different varieties and bacteria in their
gut. Some types can increase the amount of energy the individual harvests from
food, resulting in fat deposition and weight gain.



Some foods can increase good bacteria in the gut, including:

A wide variety ofplants: increasing the number of fruits , vegetables and grains in the diet
will result in increased fiber intake and more diverse bacteria in the gut.
People should ensure that vegetables and other plant-based foods make up 75% of
their meal.

Fermented foods:enhance good bacteria function while inhibiting bad bacteria growth.
Sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt, tempeh, and miso all contain good amounts of
probiotics to enhance good bacteria. Researchers have studied kimchi widely,
and the results of the study suggest anti-obesity effects. Similarly , studies
have shown that kefir can help promote overweight women's weight loss.

Prebiotic foods:
stimulate growth and activity of some of the good bacteria that help control
weight. Prebiotic fiber occurs in many fruits, including chicory root,
artichoke, onion , garlic, asparagus, leeks, banana, and avocado. Also in
grains like oats and barley.

A good night's sleep


Numerous studies have shown that having less than 5–6 hours of
sleep a night is correlated with increased obesity. There are many explanations
for this.

Research suggests that insufficient or poor sleep slows down
the process of converting calories into energy, called metabolism. When
metabolism is less effective, the body can store unused fat energy.
Additionally , poor sleep will increase insulin and cortisol production, even
triggering fat storage.



How long someone sleeps also affects regulating leptin and
ghrelin appetite-control hormones. Leptin gives brain fullness signals.

Manage your stress levels



Stress triggers the release of hormones such as adrenaline
and cortisol, which initially decrease appetite as part of the body 's fight or
response to flight.



However, when people are under constant stress, cortisol may
stay longer in the bloodstream, which will increase their appetite and may lead
to more eating.

Cortisol signals the need to replenish the body's
nutritional stores from the preferred fuel source, carbohydrate.



Insulin then transports sugar from blood carbohydrates to
muscles and brain. If the individual does not fly or use this sugar, the body
will store it as fat.

Researchers found that implementing an 8-week
stress-management intervention program resulted in a significant reduction in
overweight and obese children and adolescents' body mass index ( BMI).

Some stress management methods include:

·        
Yoga, meditation, tai-chi

·        
Breathing and relaxation.

·        
Spend time outdoors, e.g. walking or gardening

1112,World update,China Pulls No Punches In Coronavirus Words War,"Sun, 31 May 2020 02:05:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/china-pulls-no-punches-in-coronavirus.html,"





For more than three decades, China's ruling Communist Party
experienced one of the greatest political crises. A rapidly spreading outbreak
of the new coronavirus was a ""huge danger and threat"" to social
stability, Chinese President Xi Jinping cautioned top party officials in a
later publicly-published internal address.

Yet with new domestic infections near zero, China declared
victory over a virus that is still struggling to curb. Newly optimistic and
prone to criticism that it initially covered up the outbreak, China's
leadership is now trying to recast the pandemic as a political victory by
claiming that its centralized, top-down government structure made it ideally
suitable for controlling and handling the virus; official figures estimate the
virus claimed less than 5,000 lives in China.

The way the Chinese treated the coronavirus is combined with
technology, culture and very efficient policy collaboration, ""said Wang
Huiyao, president of China and Globalization's Beijing-based think tank
center."" That's something unprecedented in Western countries.

Emboldened, China has also taken a bellicose approach to
countries that question its response to coronavirus. China has lobbied European
Union officials to tone down or delete terminology that explains Beijing's misinformation
during the pandemic — a tale first published in The New York Times. On
Facebook, Chinese diplomats harassed those opposing China's pandemic treatment.

China has been particularly aggressive in countering with no
evidence from senior U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo, that the virus originated — perhaps accidentally — in a
laboratory in Wuhan , China. Scientists like U.S. Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Government 's leading infectious disease specialist, the
novel coronavirus has probably developed in nature. ""The main aim for some
U.S. politicians seeking to trick others with their obvious lies is to transfer
their own failure responsibility,"" a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry
said last month. Recently, Chinese state broadcaster published a satirical
cartoon video depicting Lego characters representing China and the US, with
America's Statue of Liberty making conflicting comments and tossing insults as
Chinese mask-wearing terra cotta warrior patiently explained.

One of the most surprising aspects of Chinese diplomacy at
this particular time is how undiplomatic it is, ""said Elizabeth Economy,
Asia's Foreign Relations Council Chair.

When Australia joined the U.S. In calling for an
investigation into the source of the virus in China, Hu Xijin, the editor-in -
chief of the Global Times State Tabloid, likened Australia to chewing gum stuck
in the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it
off."" ""You don't know how aggressive, how unreasonable the West can
be in making up their fictions,"" Hu said.

A colorful provocateur promoting the more aggressive
diplomacy of his country, Hu defended China's hawkish actions as a natural
response to American aggression. China is getting better and better, while
America's potential success is not guaranteed. ""When the U.S. continually
mocks China, can you expect us to say nothing?

Although adopting a more combative tone may have found
support among its own more nationalistic people, Beijing may not have predicted
the current global backlash.

Faulty Chinese medical products, including face masks, led
some European countries to reject Chinese donations. Racism against thousands
of Africans living in Guangzhou, China's southern capital, has washed away much
of Beijing 's goodwill built up on the African continent.

Several American lawmakers have argued that the U.S. should
waive China's sovereign legal immunity, allowing at least two states suing
China for coronavirus damage to go to court.

China changed the blame by accusing the U.S. military of
first taking the virus to Wuhan when it played in sports games last October
without evidence. The claim got traction on the mainland.

Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry known
for his bellicose Twitter activity, indicated many times that coronavirus did
not originate in China. State media outlets have consistently accused the U.S.
of downplaying the outbreak.

We believe Americans came to the Wuhan seafood market in
October when military sports games were being held in Wuhan, said one former
vendor on the Wuhan market recording the first cluster of cases of human
coronavirus. The seller won't use his name because he wants to open a new store
and won't be affiliated with the market. Americans are behind it, he said.

Hind China's offensive rhetoric is a deep sense of sadness
that other countries have ignored their role in combating the coronavirus
pandemic.

People in China feel a sense of pride because they had to
sacrifice and the leadership in the [Chinese Communist] party led them
successfully, said Susan Shirk, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
who is now chair of the 21st Century China Center at California University, San
Diego.

Others feel a nefarious purpose behind China bashing. The
real aim behind fanning ethnic discrimination flames and assigning blame is to
demonize China and curb the rise of China, wrote Lin Yueqin, a scholar at the
state-run Chinese Social Sciences Academy in April.

Ultimately, what might motivate the strident messaging of
Chinese leaders is less a desire to impress other countries, and more one to
convince their own people that China stands up to American criticism.

Whether the Chinese negotiators are misguided, or they
actually do their best to avoid the foreign narrative from creeping into
domestic Chinese discourse and undermining the Chinese Communist Party 's
legitimacy. And I'd bet the second is probably more likely than the first,
""said Economy of Foreign Relations Council.

While assigning blame might score points with populist
elements in both China and the U.S., an important geopolitical relationship
costs.

The outbreak at home was a major domestic problem for party
leadership, and I think they went overdrive to provide domestic assistance,
Shirk, who is writing a book called Overreach, about Chinese politics and
diplomacy. But what happened is they overdo it in a way that causes them this
international backlash. And it's counterproductive.

Instead of collaborating on a global health crisis,
according to U.S.-China relations experts, both countries are now further
apart.

The situation has deteriorated so much that turning things
around now and restoring the degree of international confidence that China had
previously enjoyed is unlikely. Even the most talented, cultivated and practiced
diplomats, Zi Zhongyun, a widely respected U.S.-China relations scholar at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote late April, would be challenging.

In China, voices of reason are increasingly censored and
silenced, leaving only those at the extremes of the political spectrum, Zi
lamented.



And as for online thugs ignorant and shameless, she wrote,
well, they get a free pass.

1113,World update,Hackers can steal BRAIN WAVES,"Wed, 27 May 2020 04:32:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/hackers-can-steal-brain-waves.html,"



See the destiny: attackers can get between brain waves and
hospital kit and it will get worse, IOActive senior consultant Alejandro
Hernández said.

Hernández says that the potential to copy, modify and delete
brain waves used in electroencephalography ( EEG) has already emerged, the kit
has already been hacked and the healthcare sector has taken little steps to
better protect captured brain waves.

After decades in laboratories and hospitals, encephalography
is introduced in lightweight electronic headphones and other tools that are
still largely experimental or gimmicky.

Clinically, EEG recording devices are a useful tool for
diagnosing seizures and sleeping disorders like narcolepsy.

Researchers believe recorded brain waves have the potential
to score murderers' mental abilities, create brain-to-brain interfaces where
conscious thoughts are transmitted over the internet and unconsciously enacted
by another person, or see neural-impulse-flown drones.

Before we get there, we need to lock EEG keys. Hernández
says a year's work showed him how to find gaps in EEG equipment and agreed that
registered brain waves would be considered confidential data and thus
encrypted. The researcher used a US$ 80 MindWave tool.

Pitched as a method to better evaluate how math and other
problems work for students.

                                                                                                                                                 

Hospital-grade machinery without deep pockets remains out of
reach of hackers and requires intricate knowledge of which brain waves can be
modified for a given outcome.



However, Hernández claims that there are dangerous
vulnerabilities in the home and likely hospital kit, including data stream
stealing and application holes, and garden-variety man-in-the-middle and
denial-of - service attacks.



For a committed hacker, the necessary expertise is not rare
or unobtainable.

Last week, using the open-source EEG NeuroServer package,
the hacker demonstrated a live man-in-the-middle attack on his own brain
signals.

Years ago, nobody was worried about SCADA networks just
because it works, and a decade later we 're talking about [SCADA] security ...
I 'm noticing the same thing. EEG and now it's the best time to put security in
the technology,"" Hernández said.

If you can sniff cable brain data, replay attacks [such as]
can occur if there is no security mechanism between an operator and a drone
[or] interferes. with EEG data, so it's not the same as electrodes.



For a committed hacker, the necessary expertise is not rare
or unobtainable.

So how about EEG data neural advertisers, not spammers? 

EEG data also raises prosaic risks. Hernández told Vulture
South about EEG file shares of an unnamed hospital, saying the server could be
exposed using the popular Shodan hacker search engine.

These attacks are part speculation, part tested, but all
based on the evidence that EEG, like so many emerging technology fields, has
left security in capacity progress dust. However, Hernández popped the mental
locks of popular gear within everyday hacker realms.

Bending mind

EEG's security issues are depressingly familiar results of
bad software design, Hernández said. ENOBIO EEG device (which resembles rugby
headgear rather) is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. He found minor
application vulnerabilities and ordinary EEG crashes, including Persyst
Advanced Review; Natus Stellate Harmonie Viewer; NeuroServer; BrainBay, and
SigViewer.

For example, some applications transmit raw brain waves to
another remote endpoint using the TCP / IP protocol that is not configured and
therefore vulnerable popular network attacks such as man-in-the-middle where an
intruder may intercept and change the EEG data sent,"" Hernández says.

Components such as the acquisition device, middleware, and
endpoints also lack authentication, meaning an attacker can connect to a remote
TCP port and steal raw EEG data. That same flaw can pull off the more dangerous
response attacks.

Hernández can not talk for hospital-grade EEG kit, which is
harder for hackers to access and check. But his research is bad news for those
who advocate EEG readings as authentication

The good news, the researcher says, is that the
vulnerabilities he has found can be nixed with known best practices: ""This
is a big yes – best practices should be followed from a technology perspective,
secure design, and secure programming

1114,World update,Eco-impacts of food production,"Mon, 25 May 2020 19:31:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/eco-impacts-of-food-production.html,"



Food, electricity and water: that's what the UN calls the
'nexus' of sustainable growth. As the world's population has increased and
become wealthier, demand for all three has risen rapidly. Not only has demand
risen for all three, they are also closely interlinked: food production
requires water and energy; conventional energy production needs water
resources; agriculture offers a potential source of energy.

This article focuses on food's environmental effects.
Sustaining access to a nutritious diet by everyone in the world is one of the
biggest challenges we face. In various entries, we cover the human aspects of
food and nutrition, including hunger and undernourishment, micronutrient
deficiency, diet compositions and obesity.

Eco-impacts of food and agriculture

What are food and agriculture's environmental impacts

The visualization shows a summary of some major global
impacts:

Half of the world's (ice- and desert-free) agricultural land
is used;

Agriculture uses 70 % of global freshwater withdrawals

Agriculture accounts for 78% of global ocean and freshwater
eutrophication (nutrient-rich waterway pollution)

94% Livestock is mammal biomass (excluding humans). This
means that livestock outweigh wild mammals by a factor of 15-to-1.4 of the
28,000 species assessed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, agriculture and
aquaculture are listed as a threat to 24,000 of them.

Food therefore lies at the root of trying to tackle climate
change, reduce water stress, pollute, restore land to forests or grasslands,
and protect the world's biodiversity.

Half of the world's land used for agriculture

Much of the world's land was wilderness for most of human
history: trees, grasslands and shrubbery dominated its ecosystems. This has
changed drastically in recent centuries: wild ecosystems have been squeezed out
by transforming it into agricultural land.

If we rewind 1000 years, it is estimated that just 4 million
square kilometers – less than 4% of the world's ice-free and barren land area
has been used for farming.

In visualization we see today's breakdown of global land
area. 10% of the world is covered by glaciers and 19% is barren land – deserts,
dry salt flats, beaches, sand dunes and exposed rocks.6 This leaves what we
call 'habitable land.' Agriculture uses half of all habitable land.

This leaves just 37% for forests; 11% as shrubs and
grasslands; 1% as freshwater cover; and the remaining 1% – much less than other
suspects – is made up urban area that includes cities , towns, villages, roads,
and other human infrastructure.

There is also a highly unequal distribution of land use
between livestock and human crops. If we combine pastures used for grazing with
land used to grow animal feed crops, livestock accounts for 77% of global
farming land. Though livestock occupies much of the world's agricultural land,
it only produces 18% of the world's calories and 37% of total protein.

Agricultural growth was one of the greatest environmental
effects of mankind. It has changed ecosystems and is one of the biggest
biodiversity pressures: of the 28,000 species listed as endangered on the IUCN
Red List, agriculture is listed as a threat to 24,000 of them.9 But we also
know that we can reduce these impacts – both through dietary changes, by
replacing some meat with plant-based alternatives, and by advancing technology.
In recent decades, crop yields have increased dramatically, meaning we have
saved a lot of land from agricultural production: globally, to grow the same
amount of crops as in 1961, we only need 30% of the farmland.

With consumer and producer solutions, we have an important
opportunity to restore some of this farmland back to forests and natural
habitats.

With customer and producer approaches, we have a big
opportunity to return some of this farmland back to forests and ecosystems.

Land-use food footprint

How do different food items equate land footprint? Which
foods used most and least land in production?



These comparisons are based on mass: the land used to
generate one kilogram of food.

However, it is often important to look at these contrasts in
terms of nutritional units: this provides a measure of how low or high-impact
various foods provide protein or energy / calories.



In the visualizations here we demonstrate the land footprint
of foods, measured in square meters (m2) per kilogram, 100 grams of protein,
and 1000 kilocalories. These charts are interactive and can be added and
removed using the 'add food' icon.

Food output accounts for one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions

When addressing climate change, the emphasis appears to be
on 'clean energy' options – implementing renewable or nuclear energy; enhancing
energy efficiency; or transitioning to low-carbon transport. Nevertheless,
biomass, whether in power, heat, transportation or industrial processes,
accounts for the majority – 76% – of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions.

Yet the global food system, which involves production and
post-farm processes such as refining and distribution, also leads to pollution.
And it’s a problem for which we don’t yet have viable technological solutions.

Yet the global food system, which involves production and
post-farm processes such as refining and distribution, also leads to pollution.
And it's a problem we don't have viable technological solutions yet.

Feed accounts for about 26% of global GHG emissions.

There are four main factors to remember when quantifying
food emissions. These are shown by visualization category:





Livestock & fisheries represent 31% of food emissions.

Livestock – animals raised to produce meat , dairy, eggs and
seafood – contribute to emissions in several ways. For example, ruminant
animals—mostly cattle—produce methane through their digestive processes (in a
process known as 'enteric fermentation').

Manure management, farm management, and fishing vessel fuel
use also fall into this group. This 31% of emissions only concern on-farm
'output' pollution: it does not include land use change or supply chain
pollution from animal feed crop processing: these statistics are listed
separately in other categories.

Farming accounts for 27% of food pollution.

21% of food emissions come from crop production for direct
human consumption, and 6% from animal feed production. These are the direct
emissions arising from agricultural activity – which involves factors such as
releasing nitrous oxide from fertilizer and manure application; rice methane
emissions; and farm machinery carbon dioxide.

Land usage accounts for 24% of food pollution.

Twice as many emissions result from land use for livestock
(16 percent) as crops for human use (8 percent). Agricultural growth results in
the conversion of trees, grasslands and other carbon 'sinks' into croplands or
pastures resulting in carbon dioxide emissions. 'Land use' is a total of land
use transition, savannah burning, and organic soil agriculture (plowing and
soil overturning).

Supply chains contain 18% of food emissions.

Food processing (converting farms into finished products),
transport , packaging and retail all require energy and resource inputs. Many
believe that eating local is essential to a low-carbon diet, but transport
emissions are only a very small percentage of overall food emissions — only 6
percent globally.

Reducing food pollution will be one of our biggest
challenges in the coming decades. Unlike other areas of energy production where
viable prospects for upgrading low-carbon energy – renewable or nuclear – are
visible, the ways of decarbonizing agriculture are less evident. We need inputs
like fertilizers to meet rising food demands, and we can't avoid cattle
producing methane. We will need a range of solutions: dietary changes; food
waste reduction; agricultural production improvements; and low-carbon food
alternatives are scalable and affordable.

1115,World update,"Teleportation is here, but we didn't expect","Wed, 20 May 2020 20:54:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/teleportation-is-here-but-we-didnt.html,"





In 2005, the necrology of physicist Asher Peres in Physics
Today magazine told us that when a journalist asked him if quantum teleportation
could hold a person's soul as well as their body, the scientist replied:
""No, not the body, only the soul."" More than only a simple joke,
Peres' answer gives a perfect description, embedded in a metaphor, of the
nature of a phenomenon we've seen.

Teleportation in real science started to take shape in 1993,
thanks to a theoretical analysis published in Physical Review Letters by Peres
and five other researchers, setting the framework for quantum teleportation. Apparently,
it was the idea of co-author Charles Bennett to equate the proposed phenomenon
with the common concept of teleportation, but there is an essential difference
between fiction and reality: in the latter, traveling is not important, but
material, which transfers properties from the original matter to that of the
destination matter.

Quantum teleportation is based on a hypothesis that
physicist Albert Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen
described as the EPR paradox in 1935. As a result of the laws of quantum
physics, two particles could be obtained and separated in space to continue
sharing their properties as two halves of a whole.

Therefore, an action on one of them (on A, or Alice,
according to the nomenclature used) will immediately influence the other (on B,
or Bob). This ""spooky behavior at a distance,"" in Einstein 's words,
would appear capable of exceeding the limit of light speed.

This phenomenon 's theory, called quantum entanglement, was
later developed by John Stewart Bell in 1964 and supported by numerous
experiments. Peres, Bennett and their collaborators' work proposed that a third
particle might interact with Alice's and lose a quantum state—the value of one
of Bob's physical properties—to be transferred to that of Bob, to restore that
state.

By moving matter, the Bob particle would be turned into a
duplicate of the interactive Alice particle, so there would never have been
physical interaction between them.

TELEPORT QUBITS

Several experiments have achieved this quantum teleportation
since 1998, initially using individual photons, then atoms and complex systems.
At first, the phenomenon was demonstrated at a short distance, increasing to
hundreds of meters and kilometers in subsequent studies.

The current record is the teleportation of photons 1,400
kilometers from Earth to the Micius satellite in Earth orbit, a successful
achievement by the team led by Jian-Wei Pan at the Chinese University of
Science and Technology in Hefei (USTC) in 2017.

Which is transmitted in these experiments is bits-coded
information. A bit is a simple binary information unit that takes a value of 0
or 1. For example, the spin of a particle (a type of rotation) may contain
information in its application to quantum states.

But in the quantity version of the bit, the qubit, its value
may be either 0 or 1 or another value, such as 2, since quantity mechanics
allow overlapping states. That's why quantum computing is seen as a more
powerful technology than traditional computing, as it has much greater capacity
to store and process information.

However, it is essential to stress that quantum
teleportation does not serve to transmit data instantly or at speeds higher
than light. The explanation is that Bob requires extra knowledge about Alice's
measurements that is not transmitted through the enmeshed particle system and must
thus be transmitted through another channel; two classic bits must be
transmitted for each teleported qubit, and this can only be achieved through
conventional means that at most can exceed the speed of light.

A QUANTURE NETWORK

Yet despite this constraint, quantum teleportation
possibilities look increasingly exciting as new milestones are achieved. This
year, two research teams first documented the transmission of qutrits, or
three-dimensional information units (which can take three values, 0 , 1 and 2).

""Both studies showed qutrit teleportation. The key
difference is the tool we used, ""explains to OpenMind Bi-Heng Liu,
physicist at UCTC and co-author of an as-yet-unpublished research.

There's still some controversy at play between the two
teams, though. As explained to OpenMind by physicist Chao-Yang Lu, also from
UCTC and co-author of the other research, published in Physical Review Letters,
about his colleagues' work, ""Teleportation's very quantum existence has
not been confirmed.""

Co-author of the same study Manuel Erhard of the University
of Vienna also believes that in Liu's experiment, ""measurements and
results are not sufficient to claim genuine three-dimensional and universal
quantum teleportation."" Liu, for his part, defends his results: ""We
did numerical simulation and confirmed qutrit teleportation.""

The debate also expands the possibilities of extending the
device to more dimensions. According to Liu, ""both schemes are
scalable."" For his part, Erhard argues that his own system can easily be
extended to any dimension: ""Technological development is about further
enhancing dimensionality,"" he says. At the other hand, he's not sure if
the program of his colleagues will say the same.

But what's the point of extending these studies into more
dimensions? ""High-dimensional quantum teleportation is possible in quantum
networks,"" Erhard states to OpenMind. ""So, we envisage a potential
higher-dimensional alphabet-based quantum network. These come with the
advantage of higher information capacities and, for example , greater noise
resistance.

Going from qubit to qutrit, and from there to ququart, and
so on, lays the basis for future quantum computing networks. Lu hopes that his
method will achieve so-called quantum supremacy, the power of classical
computing to solve unattainable problems: ""We are introducing multi-photon
multi-dimensional quantum computing experiments called boson sampling, and
hopefully in the near future we expect to monitor 30-50 photons to achieve
quantum supremacy.""

It seems like the research world launched a full-throttle
game recently, ""what superpower would you choose? ""For those who want
invisibility, engineers are developing exotic materials that can bend the light
of an object out of sight. For would-be telepaths, neurobiologists are working
on ways to read one person's brain wave patterns and transmit them to the head
of another.

Perhaps my personal favorite is the most insane fantasy
force of all: teleportation, the ability to arrive without flying. Imagine
being able to dematerialize from your living room and wake up in Venice or the
Amazon rainforest or Saturn's rings (wearing a fitting space suit, of course).
The idea is so seductive that it has been a staple of science fiction since
Star Trek and Doctor Who's early days, but it also seems an affront to common
sense.

Fortunately, common sense does not govern the rules of
quantum physics, as demonstrated by a brief 1993 paper with a mouthful title:
""Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State Through Dual Classical and
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Channels."" In it, a team led by Charles Bennett
from IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center showed how to link two particles
together in a certain way, and how to keep them linked even at great rates.

That connection, called quantum entanglement, has remarkable
power. It allows someone holding one of the particles to instantly send a chunk
of information — the ""unknown quantum state"" in the paper's title —
to someone else holding the other particle. Because of this strange quantum
connection, information goes from person to person without physically passing
between them. It's arriving without flying.

Relocating information from one particle to another may not
sound like ""Scotty, energize,"" but two versions of the same process
at a fundamental level. Every atom in Captain Kirk 's body is a set of data
(type of atom, location, energy state, etc.); the captain as a whole is just a
huge collection of these data sets. Teleport all relevant information to a planet's
surface and re-create Kirk exactly as he was on board the ship.

Okay, maybe ... yeah. Teleportation technology has
progressed rapidly since 1993, now being tested in the laboratory. But, as the
Enterprise crew discovered repeatedly, human teleportation is hard to do right
and easy to do wrong. There could be cheaper, easier ways to attain such
superpower.

Login to Quantity Device

Even minimal teleportation may be a revelation. Physicists
build a quantum computer, a similar technology that handles information using
individual atoms or particles instead of transistors. Such a computer might,
for example, outperform conventional processors on certain types of
calculations: breaking codes and solving complex equations.

A quantum computer could contribute to the first completely
practical simulations of quantum phenomena. All biology, chemistry, and
nanotechnology operate at the quantum level. To grasp these systems on their
own terms will be a giant leap.

Teleportation is a crucial enabling technology for quantum computing
because it enables you to retrieve the computer's information without
disrupting the rest of the device. No teleport, no results. Last year, a team
led by physicist Alex Kuzmich, then at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
demonstrated a realistic method of information teleportation by tangling on
demand the atoms and photons of a device. Once you can do that, you can
leverage that quantum connection to beam data from your quantum computer and
get it exactly where you need it.

And once you construct a quantum machine, the possibilities
start. Kuzmich and others see entire ""quantum networks"" linking
different computers and providing high-speed connectivity between them. If you
think the idea sounds vaguely familiar, you 're right; it's an Internet quantity.



Security is a primary reason to go down this path. Working
with enmeshed particles requires amazing delicacy, but that also makes it
incredibly private. If someone attempts to eavesdrop an enmeshed post, the very
act of unwelcome listening disrupts the entire teleportation method. Therefore,
any message sent over a quantum internet is perfectly secure — or as good as
anything known to mankind. Heartbling bug? There's no problem.

What's about me?

Yeah, yeah, yes. You want to learn about the infinite kind
of teleportation, the kind that beams people from place to place. Two
considerations, one metaphysical and one technical, will threaten your
enthusiasm.

First, removing all the knowledge from the body of Captain
Kirk (or yours) involves understanding each atom's physical state, which would
require complete disintegration. Each time Kirk steps into the transporter, he
suicides and then gets reborn at the other end. Second, the amount of
information needed to recreate him is staggering — about 4.5 x 1042 bits, by
one estimate, recently as part of a highly entertaining graduate physics
project at Leicester University.

Nobody knows how much information to gather and send. And
note how the slightest disturbance breaks quantum enmeshment? Reassembling the
atoms will inevitably scramble knowledge. It's suicide at one end without
rebirth at the other. Kirk could put a red shirt first.

The teleportation situation becomes much less bleak if,
however, you bend the definition somewhat. As many video game players have found,
the human brain has a remarkable capacity to project itself into other objects
or simulated spaces beyond the body. NASA is using Human Exploration
Telerobotics, a project that enables astronauts to ""inhabit"" robots
in dangerous or inaccessible places.

A robot astronaut also walks outside the International Space
Station. In the near future, you can encounter space exploration through a Mars
rover or mechanical arms poking at a distant asteroid.

If that's too much for you, how about a DNA fax machine? J.
Science guru. Craig Venter suggests that if we find microbial life on Mars, we
can sequence its genome locally, transmit information, and rebuild the organism
on Earth. In theory, Venter says, the cycle could go the other way: it would be
possible to send human DNA along with a suitable incubator to distant planets
and synthesize people at the other end. Then your clone could set up shop on a
world orbiting Alpha Centauri B.

Cloning also doesn't satisfy Teleportation 's complete
superhero dream, I remember. No, what you ideally want is a complete
mind-upload to your distant doppelganger so you can be there. That would that
the teleportation problem from ""possibly impossible"" to ""wildly
complicated,"" which still leaves the brain's big information content
problem. If, however, you agree that knowledge is the only thing that
determines your mind, the mission seems feasible. You no longer need to
carefully assemble atoms in the right locations; only the evidence do.

Notice a curious common thread through all this. If you find
yourself a pile of atoms, a DNA sequence, a collection of sensory inputs or an
intricate machine device, in all these definitions you are nothing but a data
stack. According to unitary theory, quantum knowledge is never lost. Put them
together, and these two claims lead to a stunning corollary: at the most
fundamental point, physics laws suggest you 're immortal.

1117,World update,Mind Mass Control — No implant required,"Mon, 18 May 2020 17:47:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/mind-mass-control-no-implant-required.html,"



WHEN SID KOUIDER appeared at Slush, Helsinki 's annual
start-up showcase, wearing an ascot cap and a gadget he said would lead into a
new age of technical mind control, nobody thought he was nuts. No, he's just
entered the long line of entrepreneurs (see: Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg) who
think we'll control our computers with our thoughts one day.

The quest to combine mind and machine dates back to at least
the 1970s, when scientists started drilling into peoples' skulls and implanting
the first computer-brain interfaces—electrodes that translate brain cell
activity into data.



Today, BCIs can control Parkinson's disease tremors and
regain some basic movement in paralyzed people. But they're all surgically
implanted, but very experimental. Even so, Musk's likes already imagine a
future where we'll all have chips in our brains, replacing our need for
keyboards, mouses, touchscreens, joysticks, steering wheels, and more.

That won't happen anytime soon. Mind mysteries remain
enormous, and implanting hardware into healthy brains — well, forget that, at
least until the FDA considers it safe (light-years away). Meanwhile, a wave of
companies bet on bringing Mind Control Lite to the masses with a neural
interface that requires no surgery.

That's when Kouider arrives. His startup, NextMind, creates
a non-invasive neural interface that sits on one's back and transforms brain
waves into data for tracking compatible devices.

Kouider 's dream starts with simple tasks (sending text messages
with a thought; calling up a particular picture in your camera roll with
passing thoughts) and finishes somewhere near science fiction (controlling
every tool in our universe, like Fantasia's sorcerer). ""It's true,""
he said at Slush, ""and the possibilities are endless.""

Going the non-chirurgical route comes with some trade-offs,
namely all that skin and bone between your soggy brain and any device trying to
read the neural signals it sends.

In the other hand, it's cheaper, it's healthier, and
iterating or pushing software updates much easier when you don't need to open
someone's mouth. And for BCI 's pledge, people must first see that this stuff
can be useful at all. Tools like NextMind do the trick.

I had a chance to check the NextMind system in December, a
few weeks after Kouider gave his Slush chat. He flew from Paris to San
Francisco and held the tool casually in his luggage. It weighs around 60 grams
like a kiwi fruit, and bears a slight resemblance to flattened TIE warrior.

NextMind is essentially a dressed-up electroencephalogram,
or EEG, used to monitor electrical activity in the brain. It's not that
different from the methods Kouider used as neuroscience professor before he ran
NextMind. His Paris lab specialized in consciousness studies.

EEGs still need gel and some skin preparation in hospital
settings, but recently researchers have established usable dry electrodes that
only involve skull touch. The NextMind tool uses these along with a proprietary
substance that Kouider says is ""extremely sensitive to electrical
signals."" (He wouldn't tell me exactly what the substance is.)

Kouider put the device on my head; it comes with tiny
comb-like teeth that brush through hair to keep the device right on the back of
the skull. (Kouider, who's bald, wears a clipped hat back.)

There, the device's electrodes are well placed to monitor
visual cortex activity, a tiny region in the brain's back. This then converts
the signals into digital data , processes them on the computer, uses a
machine-learning algorithm to decode them, and converts them into commands.

Kouider led me through a testing exercise on a laptop to
build my ""neural profile""—in effect, how my visual cortex lit up to
my eyes concentrating on different items.

(I followed a sequence of blinking triangles across the
screen; you only have to do this once, and only for a few minutes.) The
NextMind tool is intended to operate on everyone, but it works better when
somebody's been training. Kouider says it's a neural feedback loop: Ah, when I
concentrate on that, it's on the phone.

Generated neural profile, I was able to play games. NextMind
launches its CES developer kit in January. The company designed a few
prototypes to demonstrate what its software can do to court developers.

I tried one on Nintendo's Duck Hunt, which Kouider played as
a child. Kouider leaned as ducks danced across the screen. ""Try
aiming,"" he whispered, ""with your eyes.""

I focused my attention on the ducks and erupted within a
second. A set of demonstrations repeated this little magic trick. I changed the
channel on a mock TV set by watching a screen corner.

I unlocked a digital vault by pincoding the right numbers. I
adjusted the colors on Kouider 's package of smart lightbulbs. It's hard to say
why you'd have to do these things with your mind, but when you do, you feel
like a Jedi.

NextMind isn't the first organization to build non-invasive
BCIs for the public. Another company, CTRL-Labs, launched a developer kit for a
similar non-invasive interface last year. It also uses dry electrodes, but it's
a cuff and catches nerve signals. Facebook purchased the company in September
for nearly $1bn.

I had a chance to try CTRL-Labs' system myself a few months
ago. The demo was planned to demonstrate the company's vision: ""The
CTRL-Labs question is not, how can we make our devices more capable? ""As
co-founder Thomas Reardon told Slush in 2018.

""It's how we are more competent ourselves? I put my arm's
monitor and played games. One involved a dinosaur running over hurdles. With
just a twitch of my finger, the dinosaur jumped. At one point, Patrick Kaifosh
(then CTRL-Labs' CTO, now research manager for Facebook Reality Labs) entered
the credentials to open his laptop by staring at it.

Named neuroauthentication.



The system, like most BCI research, uses the motor cortex,
the brain component the controls movement. Reardon 's breakthrough was in
singling out the spinal cord 's neurons that transmit electrical signals to the
arm and hands, rather than going to the brain region itself.

Much of BCI's clinical work often includes the motor cortex,
partly because too much study has concentrated on movement disorders:
Parkinson's, paralysis, etc. Yet Kouider suggests the visual cortex provides a
richer range of neural signals for people seeking to monitor their computers.
Once I asked him why so much research was done in the motor cortex, he
hesitated and then said, ""I think that's because they make a
mistake.""

Since the NextMind app uses sight-related signals, it may
feel like gussy-up eye-tracking. So what if your eyes change the channel?
People have done it for years. (After the demo, Kouider said his BCI could
function even if I closed my eyes.) Right now, you 're gazing at things.

Eventually, Kouider claims, the system will tap into our
imagination, transforming visual thoughts into actions.

But the issue with some of these BCI devices isn't that they
can get fast enough to improve gameplay or power smart-home systems. It's if
anyone cares. InteraXon, a Canadian company, used to develop a head-worn system
that could monitor lights with thought power but ultimately gave up.



  
""Frankly, you could transform the thing much easier
with your side,"" said Scientific American's co-founder, Ariel Garten.
Although accessibility use cases will emerge for this technology, InteraXon
pivoted to make Muse a meditation headband.

Kouider is pitching the idea that NextMind 's app and other
non-invasive neural interfaces of its ilk would be like the keyboard, or the
computer mouse:

Anything that communicates with our personal technology. But
at this early stage, BCI is more like the headset of virtual-reality than the
Next Great Interface: mind-blowing in their demos, but easy to put in the box.

1118,World update,Mind wave device,"Thu, 14 May 2020 14:45:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/mind-wave-device.html,"



Many wearable devices can now monitor your heart rate,
steps, velocity, balance, temperature, and sleep. Smart devices are undoubtedly
the future, and will be used in daily lives. NeuroSky has developed a new
generation of brain-reading technology, using biosensors from
electroencephalography ( EEG). One of the first commercial brain wearables
released in 2009 could be used to play a game called Mindflex, where users
pushed a ball, attempting to use their ""brain power"" to go through an
obstacle course. MindWave and MindWave Mobile are considered the most portable
brain-reading EEG headphones available and can perform a variety of tasks, from
holding a brain-wave based meditation journal to intervening in a video. These
tools claim to enhance one's concentration and well-being, detect and alleviate
stress, and let someone play video games using their brain.

Biosensors EEG

MindWave and MindWave Mobile headsets use the same hardware
and read the same EEG signals. Research in recent years has shown that EEG
signals are related to focus, memory, and attention. The devices operate by
measuring brain electrical activity and minor brain wave shifts. MindWave
Handheld headset has one electrode on the user 's forehead. Headset operates by
detecting faint brainwave signals, interpreting their meaning, and causing
various changes in an app.

MindWave Mobile

MindWave Mobile
headset connects via Bluetooth to a PC , laptop or smartphone, unlike MindWave
that requires connection via USB port. It has a small clip attached to the ear,
and a sensor resting directly on the user's forehead, containing a single electrode.
It is powered by one AAA battery, providing up to eight hours of use.

There are several possibilities for using MindWave Phones.
This provides a range of free and paid applications and games in Apple and
Android app stores. Some of the most remarkable features is the user's ability
to play games, incorporating mind focus , attention and blinking.

One of the available games is ZombiePOP, where players must
blow up zombie heads and collect the inside medicine. Man. Up is a Doodle
Jump-like game. Players control a jumping man with keyboard arrow keys and use
the headset to vary jump height and length depending on the level of attention
and meditation. The MyndPlayer app allows users to control a video with their
minds. MyndPlayer comes with four separate videos that can be managed using
Mindwave Mobile thoughts.

Experts believe brain wearables can do what they claim to
do. The truth is, brain impulses are poor, and even the most sophisticated
laboratory instruments can have trouble detecting them. Another problem is that
all EEG devices may also receive signals from other sources, such as muscle
movements or other electrical devices that often look like EEG signals, so it
does not function properly.

The technology behind Neurosky's Mindwave Mobile is
impressive, but is evidently still very early in development. There may be even
other options, e.g. typing with the mind or pushing the cursor with the mind's
control. Besides that, the Mindwave Smartphone is certainly an fascinating
piece of technology and the first of many.





Researchers revealed a new brainwave device supposedly boosting our ability
to remember significantly more information.

A tool that gives us a dramatically enhanced memory has long
been a science fiction staple, and maybe a student's dreams. Researchers at
California University, Davis, have now unveiled a somewhat similar system that
enhances brainwaves crucial to our ability to remember information.

In a paper published to Cognitive Neuroscience, the team
said its tool improves the theta brainwaves' 'training' and memory efficiency.

In brain, electrical activity creates various types of
brainwaves that can be measured externally. In this case, theta waves occurring
at up to six cycles per second can be monitored and are actively monitored by a
brain, such as a rat navigating a labyrinth.

Entrainment systems – used by this new development – use a
mixture of sound and light to enhance brain activity and are typically sold
with little clinical support to tackle problems like anxiety and sleep.

However, the research team chose to test one system with 50
volunteers.

Amazing results

The study asked volunteers either to use the tool for 36
minutes or to listen to 36 minutes of white noise, and then perform a basic
memory check. Results showed that those who used the system both improved
memory capacity and enhanced theta wave behavior.

A second study involving 40 other participants, including a
control group that provided beta wave stimulation, followed. Beta waves are a
different type of brainwave pattern, occurring much more regularly than theta
waves, with up to 30 cycles per second during awakening. The study related
theta wave activity to improve memory performance.

Interestingly, the reverse result was a similar study using
electrical stimulation to boost theta waves, suppressing these brainwaves and
decreasing memory control.

One of those involved in the study, Prof. Charan Ranganath
admitted that the researchers were shocked at how well the system performed. What's
interesting is that after shutting it off, the system had a lasting impact on
theta operation and memory output for over half an hour, he said.

Though controversy persists about whether or not theta waves
are simply a result of normal brain activity, Ranganath thinks they may play an
important role. The neurons are more excited at the wave's height, and they can
speak to each other when the waves in two brain regions are in sync,

he said.

1119,World update,Light's dark side how artificial lighting affects the natural environment,"Tue, 12 May 2020 10:22:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/lights-dark-side-how-artificial.html,"

It's a summer night near Germany's forest lake and something
strange happens. Beyond the dark waters of the sea, a soft glow emanates from
the rings of light above the ocean.

Nearby, bobbing red torchlights — the visible spectrum's
least-disruptive component — reveal scientists' presence on the shoreline. They
're seeing what happens when they rob their night's lake animals. This experiment
near Berlin is the most ambitious of many ventures in dark countryside patches
across Europe, set up over the past few years to check what light pollution is
doing to ecosystems. Researchers are increasingly concerned about the problem.

While several studies have reported how artificial light
affects individual organisms, the impacts on entire ecosystems and their
services, such as crop pollination, are less evident. Several field studies aim
to provide answers by tracking how plant and animal populations react to both
direct and more subtle night sky luminance, known as skyglow.

Environmentalists face challenges such as accurately
measuring light and determining how multiple organisms respond. But early
studies indicate that light at night exerts omnipresent, long-term ecosystem
stress, from coasts to farmland to urban waterways, many of which are already
suffering from other, more well-known forms of pollution.

It's an significant blind spot, says Steve Long, a plant
biologist at Urbana University, Illinois, and author of Global Change Biology. We
know more about increasing CO2 impacts, he says. ""Just how severe are
light pollution impacts? We 're playing our future with what we're doing to the
world.

Dutch physiologist Frans Verheijen started researching how
lights attract animals and interfere with their behaviour. And in the 1970s,
further biological findings of light impacts started to appear in literature.

Nevertheless, it took two lateral biogeographers — Catherine
Rich, member of the Urban Wildlands Group in Los Angeles, California, and
Travis Longcore, now at Los University of Southern California. Angeles — to see
the correlations between them and organize a conference in 2002, followed by a
book, Ecological Implications of Artificial Night Lighting (Island, 2006).

In the vast majority of organisms — human, cockroach, or
plankton wisp — the process of light and dark is an important behavior
regulator. This mediates courtship, reproduction, migration, etc.

""Earth has changed drastically since life developed,
but bright days and dark nights still existed,"" says Christopher Kyba, a
physicist at Potsdam's German Geoscience Research Centre. If you change it, you
're afraid some stuff could screw up.

This change 's speed is growing. Striking photos from space
over the past two decades show how vanishing the night is. Estimates say that
more than one-tenth of the planet's land area experiences artificial light at
night — and that increases to 23 percent if skyglow is included. The scale of artificially
illuminated outdoor areas expands from 2012 to 2016 by 2 percent annually.

An unforeseen trend factor is the widespread installation of
light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which rise in popularity because they are more
energy-efficient than other bulbs. They appear to emit a wide-spectrum white
light which includes most frequencies essential to the natural world.

The phenomenon has had significant impacts on certain
species; lights are well-known, for example, to disorient migrating birds and
sea turtles. Scientists have also found that vanishing darkness disturbs the
behavior of crickets, moths and bats, and also increases bird-borne disease
transmission.

Probably the most deadly impacts on insects — vital food
sources and pollinators in many habitats. An estimation of the impact of street
lamps in Germany indicated that over a single summer, the light could wipe out
more than 60 billion insects. Some insects fly straight into lamps and sizzle;
some die after hourly circles.

Fewer studies have studied plants, but some that indicate
that light often disrupts them. In a UK study , scientists took a 13-year
record of timing of bud opening in trees and matched it with night-time
satellite illumination.

They noticed, after adjusting for urban heat, that artificial
lighting was related to trees bursting their buds more than a week earlier — a
magnitude close to that expected for 2 ° C global warming. A study of soybean
farms in Illinois6 found that light from adjacent roads and cars could delay
crop maturation by up to seven weeks and reduce yield.

Ecosystem effects

Now, some innovative projects are coming in. One of the
biggest is a field experiment in the Netherlands, where eight reserves and dark
areas host several rows of street lamps. The rows are different colors — green,
red, white, and switched off control row — and run from a grassland or heat
field into a forest.

For six years now, scientists and volunteers have used
camera traps to track small mammal activity; automated bat detectors to record
echolocation calls; mist nets to capture birds; and nest boxes to determine
timing and breeding success. Under the lights, botanists research plants.

The team found empirical evidence of the adverse effects of
light exposure on wildlife health. Songbirds roosting around the white light
had restless night, less sleep, and metabolic changes that may suggest poorer
health.

The project also investigated how light affects bats, which
had mixed fortunes under the explosion of artificial lighting. Some animals,
such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), feast on the insect
buffet they find circling lamps. Other, light-shy bats lost habitat and
vanished from some areas.

In the Netherlands report, red light had no effect on any
bat species, meaning it could be used instead of white.

But the experiment gave some surprising findings. Several
urban experiments find that nighttime artificial light causes songbirds to sing
earlier in daytime. As females prefer to select early-singing males, the
shifted dawn chorus can influence which birds will reproduce.

But the Dutch team found no impact on any of 14 species10.
The lighting may have been too poor to create an effect — it is designed to
reflect the level on country roads and bike paths, rather than an urban park's
glare.

These kinds of findings are useful to local governments,
says Kamiel Spoelstra, who leads the project at the Netherlands Institute of
Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen. Outdoor lighting regulations incorporate the
results of his team.

For example, he says, some areas trying to help local bat
populations have turned to red light, a trend he expects to develop.

Colored light also graces grasslands in southwestern
England, where a project known as Ecolight seeks proof of 'cascade effects'
where light impacts on one species have knock-on effects on the environment.

Ecolight's flickering cubes can be mistaken for an art
installation. Scientists led by Kevin Gaston, Exeter University, UK
biodiversity and conservation expert, have just finished studying 54 grassland
artificial communities.

Within some containers, bugs, slugs, pea aphids and 18 plant
species muddled around for 5 years, separated from outside world. Certain boxes
were simpler — containing plants, herbivores, or plants alone. Some were lit
with white light at night, others with amber, others only saw raw sky.

Light effects on grasslands are significant, partly because
roadside grass provides wildlife refuges and corridors in built-up areas.
Scientists discovered that amber light and, to a lesser degree, green,
inhibited trefoil flowering (Lotus pedunculatus)

The amber-lit boxes had a cascade effect. When pea aphids
changed from consuming shoots to feasting on flower heads in August, their
numbers dropped, probably due to less plentiful food.  think it's the first scientific proof of a
strong, bottom-up effect of artificial light exposure, Gaston says. The team
shows more effects in its new, unpublished research, cascading on machine
predators.

Another comprehensive experiment in a dark skies reserve in
Germany's Westhavelland Nature Park showed that these cascade effects would
spill into neighboring habitats. Street lamps built out of water near
water-filled ditches attract aquatic insects,12 says Franz Hölker, an
ecohydrologist at Berlin's Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland
Fisheries.

The insects flock to the lamps and become fodder for nearby
predators. Meanwhile, the hinterland, which would otherwise have received
insect visits, is deprived of a significant food source, he says.

These studies, which lay these relationships bare in
well-controlled, small-scale experiments, indicate ""such impacts are more
likely to be taken seriously in the field and by regulators evaluating lighting
impacts,"" says Longcore.

Artificial light can also impact ecosystem services — the
benefits ecosystems offer to humans. A research published in Nature last year
found that lighting a collection of Swiss meadows prevented plants pollinating
nocturnal insects.

A team led by Eva Knop of the University of Berne 's
Institute of Ecology and Evolution found that insect visits to plants fell by
almost two-thirds under artificial light and that daytime pollination couldn't
compensate: plants produced 13 percent less fruit. Knop's team predicted these
changes could spread through the daytime pollinator population by reducing the
amount of food available. ""This is a very significant research that
clearly shows that night artificial light inhibits pollination,"" says
Hölker.

Light skies

Most of Earth remains free from direct artificial illumination,
but skyglow — illumination scattered back to Earth by aerosols and clouds — is
more common. It may be so small that humans can not see it, but researchers
estimate it may still threaten 30 percent of vertebrates and 60 percent of
nocturnal and exquisitely sensitive invertebrates.

Skyglow ""almost definitely"" affects biodiversity,
Gaston notes, since the amount is far above the levels to induce many
biological responses. And yet, he notes, It's very hard to do the conclusive
analysis.

That's where the project forest-lake comes in. Glowing light
circles float over cylinders sunk into Lake Stechlin, recreating skyglow. They
are Leibniz physicist Andreas Jechow 's job, who had to find a way to generate
low-level, even illumination without blocking daylight or hindering scientists
entry.

Using state-of-the-art photonics devices such as an advanced
ray-tracing device, he and his team did this. ""As biologists, we were too
unaware of the nature of light as a physical phenomenon,"" says Mark
Gessner, project manager, known as The LakeLab, and co-leader of his
artificial-light project, ILES (Illuminating Lake Ecosystems). In the past,
several studies have also failed to account for shifting the Moon through the
sky, he says.

The concept for ILES was to expand results from a well-known
zooplankton study, which during the day live in deep, dark water and migrate
night into shallower waters to graze on algae.

This movement is the world's largest biomass migration. A
study14 in lakes near Boston , Massachusetts, in the late 1990s indicated that
skyglow decreases the zooplankton 's increase by 2 meters and the number of
species that grow by 10–20%. This behavioral shift can be an unrecognized
catalyst of essential lake processes including algal blooms.

The 24 cylinders, each 9 meters in diameter, look from the
surface like a fish farm. Lighting them with various 'skyglow' rates and
monitoring the distribution of the tiny plankton using video cameras,
scientists found that skyglow had no significant impact on zooplankton
movement.

""We may have a modified migration trend, but I'm not
sure yet,"" says Gessner. While there's an impact, it looks like it's not
the profound one we've been expecting.

The unexpected outcome characterizes these challenging
studies. Gessner points out their experiment just completed their first season.
Maybe we don't need to be worried or maybe less worried — we don't know, at
least as far as the effects of skyglow on lakes are concerned, he says.

Bright future

Soft, careful research, but the field coalesces as proof
accumulates, says Gaston. The last two or three years saw a drastic change in
our perception,he says.

Nevertheless, changes are required. Also calculating
exposure is difficult. In the field, the light an individual receives may be difficult
to measure; for example, a bird can migrate to a nearby tree's shadow to avoid
illumination. Some scientists tried to tie light meters to birds to get a
better understanding of dose.

As the results show, one thing ecologists frustrate and
encourage is that the solution is at hand.

Longcore also collects published data on how various
animals, such as shearwaters and sea turtles, react to different sections of
the spectrum and adapt the results to the spectra produced by different
lighting styles. He needs to advise lighting decisions — for example, which
type of lamp to use on a bridge, and which at a seaside resort.

Technicians and environmentalists know that well-considered
lighting can perform its task without, as Kyba puts it, ""spraying light
into the sky."" For certain areas of the spectrum, LEDs can be changed to
glow, dim, and turn off remotely. ""My dream,"" Kyba says, ""is
that in 30 years the streets will be beautifully lit — better than today — but
we will use one-tenth of the sun.""

She said shopping,
malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, and other public spaces, including
playgrounds and gyms, could reopen Thursday, May 14.

From Monday 18 May,
schools would return to regular classes, while bars would wait until Thursday
21 to reopen.

She warned that
groupings — including gatherings, marriages, funerals and group bookings in
restaurants or bars — would also be limited to 10 participants.

China's
Wuhan records coronavirus first since lockdown

Wuhan, the focal
point of China's novel coronavirus outbreak, declared Monday the first cluster
of infections since a month ago a quarantine on central Chinese city was
lifted, raising fears about a wider disease revival.

The latest
infections sounded a note of caution in China's attempts to relax
coronavirus-related restrictions as companies rebuild and individuals return to
work.

Wuhan recorded five
new confirmed cases, all in the same residential complex. One of them was an 89-year-old
male patient 's wife identified in the city's first confirmed case in over a
month ago.



""Currently,
the city 's mission of disease prevention and control is still very high,""
Wuhan health authority said in a statement. ""We must resolutely contain
the rebound risk.""

Both the new
confirmed cases were previously identified as asymptomatic, people who test
positive for the virus and can infect others but do not display clinical
symptoms like fever.

Australia's
biggest states avoid calming lockdowns

Australia's most
populous states have limited Covid-19's calming limits, including some states
permitted small gatherings and prepared to open restaurants in line with the
federal government's three-stage business reopening program.

On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced plans to
lift most curbs by July in a three-step initiative to bring nearly 1 million
people back to work, as the country has reduced new Covid-19 infections to less
than 20 a day with tight lockdowns.

Australia 's cumulative Covid-19 deaths remain below 100.



Saturday's nation's capital, Canberra, and some states,
encouraged people to start visiting each other again, with up to 10 people
attending indoor and outdoor meetings, including weddings.

Throughout South Australia, restaurants and cafes will be
permitted outdoor dining from Monday for up to 10 guests, and pubs, bars and
restaurants will reopen next Friday in the Northern Territory.

Nonetheless, New South Wales and Victoria states, which make
up over half of the country's population and almost two-thirds of the country's
Covid-19 incidents, expect to announce proposals to relax business restrictions
only next week.

New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard said nearly
300,000 people were screened for coronavirus in the state on Saturday, and
while 3,000 had screened positively, 82 percent were now well again.

Before Mother's Day on Sunday, Hazzard urged people not to
give up on social distancing and hand-washing while visiting their mothers.



""It's really hard not to hug your mum or kiss your mum,
but it's the wisest choice not to,"" said Hazzard.

Most nursing homes around the country have begun allowing
restricted visits this weekend, with some requiring temperature tests and flu
vaccine evidence before allowing visitors with a strict 1.5 meter social gap.

Although schools reopened last week in Western Australia and
South Australia, Monday's state of Queensland was ready to send back
kindergarten, year 1, 11, and 12 students.

but I have got a really excited grade 1 student who
absolutely can not wait to go to school in my home, and I'm sure there's still
plenty of kids and moms ready to go back to school, Minister Steven Miles
told reporters Saturday.

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Australia's fourth largest
bank, told workers that they were planning for a phased return to work, with no
more than 35% of their employees in the office at any time.

Today, New Zealand announced two new Covid-19 incidents,
bringing the country 's total to 1492. Twenty-one coronavirus-related deaths.

1121,World update,"South Korea tried 'a fresh everyday life with Covid-19.' Four days later, Seoul discovered a new cluster.","Sun, 10 May 2020 07:56:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/south-korea-tried-fresh-everyday-life.html,"

Go out, socialize and have fun, South Korea's government
told its citizens, announcing the start of ""a new everyday life with
Covid-19""—while keeping a watchful eye on any indication of backwardness,
any need for restrictions to snap back into place.

It wasn't long.



On Saturday, the fourth day of the new process, Seoul's
mayor ordered all the bars and nightclubs in the capital to shut down
indefinitely after a cluster of dozens of coronavirus infections was
discovered.

South Korea initially fought the pandemic with such
effectiveness that it became a blueprint quoted internationally, all but
avoiding a massive epidemic without strangling nearly as much of its economy as
other nations. Now it's trying something just as hard: moving gradually, safely
closer to something like everyday life.

Policy leaders, health professionals, and most of the public
are well aware that, once a vaccine exists, easing restrictions would lead to
more illnesses and probably more deaths. The trick is to do so without the
contagion coming out.

After a 29-year-old man tested positive for the virus on
Wednesday, epidemiologists quickly discovered that on May 2, Seoul's famous
nightlife district, Itaewon, had visited three nightclubs. By Saturday night,
they said they tracked 7,200 people who had visited five Itaewon nightclubs
where the virus might have spread ben.

Club-goers and people who had close contact with them have
reported 27 cases so far, said Kwon Jun-wok, a senior disease-control official,
during a briefing on Saturday.

The mayor, Park Won-soon, cited a higher number, saying at
least 40 infections were related to nightclubs. As he closed the clubs, he
scolded patrons who had failed to practice safeguards such as wearing masks,
accusing them of endangering the entire nation's health.

Oil's decline and pandemic force Gulf
states to contend with migrant workers' large armies.

The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how many cultures
function lopsidedly.

In the wealthiest societies in the Middle East, everyday
life machinery relies on migrant workers from Asia, Africa, and poorer Arab
countries — millions of ""tea people,"" housemaids, doctors,
construction staff, deliverers, cooks, garbagemen, guards, hairdressers,
hoteliers, and more who often outnumber the native population.

Yet with oil prices cut and tourism gone, the Persian Gulf
countries face big change.



The fallout is bleakly straightforward for their foreign
workers — more than a tenth of the world's migrants — who sent over $124
billion in 2017 to their home countries. Lockdowns have cost tens of thousands
of jobs, leaving them to ration dwindling food supplies as their families
struggle without remittances.

Coronavirus torn into inadequate dormitory-style worker
accommodation. And xenophobia escalates.

Like migrants in Latin America, Eastern Europe, India and
beyond, some go home empty-handed.

Simultaneously, oil-dependent countries with many
middle-class or poor people, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman, can no
longer guarantee the high living standards and subsidies their people take for
granted.

The latest in science: more children
died of coronavirus-related illness; a drug cocktail shows promise for
Covid-19.

Three young kids died of a mysterious coronavirus-related
syndrome in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday, and over 73 were
sickened.

                                                                                         

At least 50 cases of rare disease reported in European
countries, including Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy, and a
handful of cases in other U.S. nations.

The disorder, called ""inflammatory pediatric
multisystem syndrome,"" can send children into a kind of toxic shock with
very low blood pressure and blood inability to efficiently transport oxygen and
nutrients.

Symptoms can include fever, rash, reddish eyes, swollen
lymph nodes, and extreme abdominal pain — but not usually two common Covid-19
characteristics: cough and shortness of breath. Nevertheless, children may
screen positive for the indications of infection with the virus or antibodies.

Treatments included steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin,
high-dose aspirin, antibiotics, supportive oxygen, and a ventilator in the most
serious cases.

Separately, researchers in Hong Kong reported in a new study
published in The Lancet that patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 tend to
improve faster when treated with a combination of antiviral drugs compared to a
group receiving a mix of fewer drugs.

The more effective combination included lopinavir-ritonavir
(two medications sold in one product under the Kaletra brand name); ribavirin
used to treat hepatitis C; and interferon beta-1b, which controls inflammation
and suppresses viral growth and helps cure multiple sclerosis.

The comparison group got only lopinavir-ritonavir, which
some doctors stopped using after a recent clinical trial found that results in
critically ill Covid-19 patients were not substantially improved.

Patients with the broader cocktail tested negative in seven
days on average compared to 12 days on average among those treated with
lopinavir-ritonavir alone. The cocktail also cut Covid-19 symptoms in half,
from eight days to four days.

In a major development that aims to significantly broaden
research capability in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved
the first antigen test that can easily identify a person being infected with
coronavirus. The study, by San Diego's Quidel Company, obtained F.D.A.
emergency use authorization late Friday, according to a notice on the agency's
website.

Experts said authorizing a Covid-19 antigen test would
improve testing efforts by offering medical staff and health authorities a
cheap method for mass rapid research. Further evolved antigen tests also hold
promise for home use, including a home pregnancy kit.

A food line rises in wealthy Geneva.

Beginning before dawn, more than 1,500 people joined a food
line that extended half a mile or more across Geneva on Saturday, marking the
misery caused by steps to contain the coronavirus in one of the wealthiest and
most expensive cities in the world.

""They had to wait several hours to get a bag with food
worth around $20 in it, that's a symbol of the community's people,"" Djann
Jutzler said. a medical charity spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders, who
funded a local charity distribution.

With the number of virus cases dropping, Switzerland will
begin to ease its lockdown on Monday, enabling primary schools, stores,
restaurants and bars to open and restart public transport.

More than 30,000 Swiss contracted Covid-19 and more than
1,500 died, but on Friday officials reported only 43 new cases of infection,
marking a steady decline.

Demonstrations against Saturday's shutdown in Bern, the
capital, and other cities showed that public frustration; and Geneva's food
lines testify to increasing hardship.

Saturday's food handouts in Geneva were the second in a week
coordinated by Geneva Caravan, a local charity that cares for the elderly and
the needy, drawing much greater crowds than the first. A study of several
hundred people showed those without legal citizenship, and more than half
without medical benefits.

The lines could raise awareness of mounting needs.
Organizers who depend entirely on donations for rice, pasta, vegetable oil and
other essential commodities are seeing a growing public response. ""People
are increasingly generous,"" Mr. Jutzler said.

1122,World update,The case for better wastewater treatment in Bolivia,"Sat, 09 May 2020 08:48:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-case-for-better-wastewater.html,"

Efficient investment in wastewater and other sanitation
services is vital to achieving public health benefits, improving the
environment, and enhancing life quality. Safe water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) programs are important to prevent disease and protect human health
during outbreaks of infectious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.

Over the past two decades, Bolivia has made strong strides
in expanding access to water and sanitation facilities. Yet, even though access
to piped water and wastewater collection has increased, the quality of those
services is still not optimal, particularly for the poorer population. Service
interruptions and blockages are normal. Also, water quality and wastewater
service delivery remains a challenge, particularly in areas facing water
scarcity.

Bolivia reports that only 27% of wastewater is treated (WSP,
2016). In cities with over 10,000 inhabitants, wastewater treatment is just
39%. Wastewater treatment facilities need to be upgraded and expanded in cities
like El Alto, Oruro, Cochabamba and Tarija; while La Paz, with about 800,000
inhabitants, has no treatment facilities. Instead, untreated wastewater is
dumped into the Choqueyapu and La Paz Rivers, further rising water
contamination and endangering human health.

Urban ization has greatly increased domestic and industrial
water demand in Bolivia, and untreated wastewater is often reused for
water-scarce irrigation. Polluted water downstream of the La Paz River is
unregulated for irrigation. Yet due to a lack of oversight, its unregulated
usage presents potential risks to the health of urban consumers of agricultural
products as well as farmers and their families' health.

In order to tackle these problems, the Ministry of
Environment and Water (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua-MMAyA) began in 2017
to establish a National Strategy for Wastewater Management and Reuse aimed at
addressing both water contamination and public health concerns caused by low
rates of wastewater treatment and excessive use in agriculture and at
encouraging reuse within a broader framework. The Global Water Protection &
Sanitation Partnership (GWSP), a multi-donor trust fund housed in the World
Bank's Water Global Program, provided technical assistance to formulate the
plan.

To achieve these goals, particularly in La Paz, a wastewater
treatment plant is desperately required as well as a network of trunk sewers
and emissaries to transport wastewater to the treatment plant itself.

But building a new facility is the beginning. Develop and
robustly execute service and maintenance plans to ensure the viability and
efficacy of the current La Paz wastewater management program.

Help must also include: I improving policy, structural,
regulatory and funding mechanisms for wastewater management; (ii) increasing
public awareness of the value and costs of wastewater treatment; (ii)
supporting the environmental regeneration of watercourses in the watersheds of
Choqueyapu and La Paz to minimize public health;

To close the sanitation gap in Bolivia, it must also go
beyond traditional wastewater collection and treatment approaches and explore
non-conventional sanitation structures, including off-sewage network approaches
and fecal sludge management.

Our expertise in promoting wastewater control, national and
global, also shows valuable lessons, including:

Selecting wastewater systems should be based on maximum
life-cycle costs (i.e. investment costs, operational and maintenance costs).

The facilities' positive social implications should be
considered across the cycle: employment created by the plant's construction,
operation, and maintenance; improvements in property prices following
improvement of the receiving water body; alternative water sources from reuse
for farmers; and improved health from better water quality.

The value of ensuring sufficient ability of utilities to
perform and sustain wastewater treatment. The need to ensure that utilities
produce adequate revenue to pay for operating and maintenance costs.

Bolivia's WSS field consists of many institutions. For
example, MMAyA, the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (Viceministerio
de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Basico-VAPSB) and the Department of Water
Supplies and Irrigation (Viceministerio de Recursos Hídricos y Riego);

are the sector authorities responsible for water and
wastewater policies, technical requirements and budgeting for sector
investments when these are priorities. In comparison, local councils are
responsible for delivering WSS services.

Municipalities may provide these services directly or
through agencies offering basic water and sewerage services (Entidades
Prestadoras de Servicios Basicos de Agua y Alcantarillado, EPSAS), which
usually join municipal or utility cooperatives in urban areas. Cross-sectoral
and multi-stakeholder cooperation is also crucial to Bolivia's wastewater
strategy's progress.

To accomplish this, national and local governments and water
providers, with funding from the World Bank and other development partners, are
working together to integrate circular economic concepts into the design of the
wastewater treatment plant in La Paz.

Wastewater can be a valuable resource if there are
appropriate policies, technology and financial opportunities. The World Bank
stands ready to assist Bolivia in-wastewater treatment and reuse coverage
levels to eventually minimize water pollution and achieve environmental
recovery, improve people's health, and contribute to building climate
resilience in urban agricultural areas.

1123,World update,Governments facing tough choices in COVID-19 crisis,"Sat, 09 May 2020 08:22:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/governments-facing-tough-choices-in.html,"

Countries in East
Asia and Pacific must extend successful poverty reduction programs Globally,
the COVID-19 pandemic is destroying lives and livelihoods. Until the pandemic,
the World Bank expected 35 million people in East Asia and the Pacific to
escape poverty by 2020.

At this pace, the crisis could set back cumulative poverty
reduction gains achieved over the past decade. These forecasts show the level
of distress and warrant immediate action.



Media is packed with tragic tales of affected families. We
know they aren't isolated cases. Poor households are more likely to rely on
earnings from informal work arrangements, have minimal savings, and typically
lack employment security, health insurance, or paid leave, rendering them
highly vulnerable.

For example, over three-quarters of all non-agricultural
workers in Myanmar, Indonesia and Laos have no formal employment and lack
access to formal social insurance programs.



Different industries were especially hit in some countries.
In Tonga, where one-third of the population depends on tourism, if the crisis
prolongs, poverty may hit three-quarters of all households living in this
sector. Urban poor are at risk, living in overcrowded areas, with limited
access to good infrastructure and health services.

Internal migrants and their relatives are also seriously
impacted. When richer countries see steep rises in unemployment, a significant
share of households in East Asian and Pacific countries can run the risk of
seeing this important source of income decline in this period.

Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, have extended
flagship social assistance programs and temporarily increased benefits.



In the formal sector, countries cancel or delay social
insurance payments to help employees and businesses in the short run and enact
different types of wage incentives to retain job connection where possible.

Such services require higher government spending when
revenue declines. In these unprecedented times, countries are expected to run
even greater fiscal deficits than normal, resulting in increased domestic and
external debt. It makes it even more necessary to ensure that government
funding is used to improve productive services that can be easily extended
using current administrative or digital technologies.

Policy measures that are useful for both the immediate and
long-term crisis should be promoted. Expanding school feeding and wellness
services, for example, will reduce long-term human capital losses. Reducing
import tariffs will reduce domestic business costs and reinforce global value
chains.

Lockdowns may be required to slow pandemic spread, but they
affect livelihoods. Trade-off is more severe for developing countries lacking
fiscal ability or distribution mechanisms to increase household social
assistance or implementation ability to impose social distance.

For policymakers to determine when to phase out lockdowns,
access to timely and reliable information on virus transmission and its
economic and social impacts would be crucial. Key statistics on unemployment,
food prices, and early signs of malnutrition are among those that need to be
carefully weighed along with virus-related data.

They will also need to track countries' lessons carefully in
the midst of relaxing similar restrictions.



International cooperation and assistance in resolving the
crisis would be crucial. Governments must learn from each other and apply best
practices in real-time response to the pandemic.

1124,World update,COVID-19 in fragile settings: Conflict-sensitive response,"Fri, 08 May 2020 12:19:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/05/covid-19-in-fragile-settings-conflict.html,"

As seen in the recent resurgence of polio in Syria, cholera
outbreaks in war areas in Yemen, and spread of Ebola in volatile eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) regions. Indeed, in 108 refugee camps, 364
disease outbreaks occurred between 2009 and 2017. Fragility and dispute reverse
hard-earned development advances and stunt opportunities for girls, youth, and
the poorest. They undermine health services in the process, leaving communities
more vulnerable to disease outbreaks.

(The FCV). These countries are already seeing rising
incidents, and unprecedented steps are being taken by governments and
international partners to save lives and alleviate the worst socio-economic
impacts.

From DRC, Mali and Niger to Papua New Guinea, Haiti,
Afghanistan, Yemen and Gaza. Even more countries have requested assistance and
operations are being completed quickly with three key goals during this
unprecedented crisis: helping countries undertake emergency health operations
and improving economic resilience, protecting the poorest and most vulnerable
families, supporting business and saving jobs.

The UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan seeks to
combat the virus in the world's poorest nations, meeting the most vulnerable
people's humanitarian needs. Simultaneously, the UN COVID-19 Response and
Recovery Fund helps low- and middle-income countries to address the
virus-induced health and development crisis.

Moreover, — due to poor governance and state structures, unequal
access to services for disadvantaged communities and, too frequently,
neighborhood policy distrust. Such countries can also face compounding threats,
including shocks, forced displacement, and food insecurity.

It is critical that the immediate response of countries and
longer-term investments tackle these realities to avoid exacerbating existing
sources of fragility and, then, help create resilience to both this crisis and
potential shocks.

UN-World Bank Joint Report, Strategies for Peace: Inclusive
Solutions to Deter Violent Conflict, as well as the recent FCV Strategy for the
World Bank Community, include a collection of crucial concepts that can help
direct country-level response efforts in these demanding settings.

Conflict-sensitive questions. Countries affected by FCV, in
active conflict or war, all face distinct threats, and the new challenge
presented by the global pandemic will intersect with current disparities and
grievances and systemic ability gaps.

Pandemic, socio-economic effects, and response can all
intensify existing conflict risks. The root causes of conflict and fragility
and sources of resilience in each situation need to be clearly understood,
keeping in mind that supporting these populations and helping to create local
community resilience through women's groups and local social networks is
essential, as was done with the Refugee and Host Communities Support Project in
Niger.

There could also be tentative new opportunities for peace in
some areas, as has been seen in some countries in recent weeks since the UN
Secretary-General's call for global ceasefire.

Trust and inclusion counts. Obviously, public services
including health, social security and education are important in themselves,
but they are also the key ways citizens communicate directly with the state,
including local institutions. They are the primary medium for government faith
and trust.

Ensuring fair access to resources and preventing the
impression of exclusion by some communities help mitigate tensions that
threaten local and national authorities' legitimacy. Fair service delivery
decreases community competition and helps preserve public trust that is
essential to mobilizing collective efforts to combat the virus.

Topics of community engagement. Whether addressing the
immediate health threat or supporting and maintaining broken livelihoods,
governments need support so that they can engage publicly with broad sectors of
society — including youth, women, trade unions, the private sector, and
marginalized groups — in and beyond the emergency phase to help analyze,
design, implement, and monitor programs.

For example, during the recent Ebola outbreak in eastern
DRC, addressing grievances and building confidence by investing in employment
and social infrastructure through the Community Resilience Initiative was as
critical as health interventions. They also help promote support and awareness
of the concerted emergency measures required now, as well as the challenging
trade-offs required to handle the long-term socioeconomic effects.

Partnership problems. To both meet urgent health needs and
seek to improve governance and resolve the long-term effects of the crisis.
These collaborations are already at work: a $26.9 million World Bank grant
through IDA, its fund for the poorest countries, is being introduced with WHO
in Yemen to help reduce the spread and minimize risks associated with COVID-19.

Joint research and preparation by governments with UN, World
Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral partners – in ways that reduce the
risk of conflict, maintain stability, and protect health systems – would be
important. This will build on existing capacities and structures rather than
replacing them or set up parallel responses to the burden on affected
countries.

For FCV-impacted countries and citizens, COVID-19 recovery
involves economic development, as well as stronger institutions and social
stability that will help inoculate against the next crisis. We will now
collectively help countries to lay the groundwork to ""develop
better.""

1125,World update,Iraq struck with a new pandemic: domestic violence,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:25:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/iraq-struck-with-new-pandemic-domestic.html,"

""More morphine!"" screamed Malak's mother, her
20-year-old daughter hospitalized after a marital fight, leaving her badly
burned — the latest victim of domestic abuse aggravated by Iraq's isolation.

Since mid-March, the nationwide lockdown is intended to keep
coronavirus cases down in the country, but has led to a spike in another sad
statistic: domestic violence.

Iraq's community police chief, Brigadier General Ghalib
Atiyah, told AFP that his domestic violence cases have risen by an average of
30% since the curfew came into effect — with some places seeing as much as a
50% spike.

The United Nations in Iraq (UNAMI) announced in a single
week: ""A woman's rape with special needs, spousal assault, immolation and
self-immolation, as well as self-inflicted injuries caused by spousal violence,
sexual exploitation of children, and suicide ...

relatives, Malak's mother told Human Rights Watch. He beat Malak so badly on
April 8 that she ...

Her swollen, burnt face video and pained wails in the
hospital went viral, but public attention could not save her: the young woman
died 10 days later. ""All Malak wanted to see her children,"" said Hana
Edwar, a longtime righteous woman ...

Her NGO, Amal (hope in Arabic), during curfew reported a
""dramatic"" increase in domestic violence incidents, she told AFP.
""Everyone spends long time together inside the home. The most trivial
thing can turn into a controversy ...

There, many girls are married at a young age and subject to
domestic abuse. According to the UN, 46 percent of married women in Iraq have

Due to the curfew, Atiyah told AFP, the community police

normal city halls. There are very few shelters available for victims, so it

Article 41 of Iraq's penal code grants men the right to
""punish"" their wives and children ""within the bounds of law and
customs,"" a provision also used to dismiss cases brought against
relatives. Many misconduct allegations in tribal courts, 

After Malak's public outcry, three of her male relatives

After Malak's public uproar, three of her male relatives

future perpetrators.

1126,World update,Designing a logo,"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 09:32:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/designing-logo.html,"

Ever seen a major brand without a logo? No? No? That's
because there's none. A logo influences how your customers view your brand. You
want the logo to be outstanding. But how you get there?

Don't worry! This handy guide will teach you how to design
the perfect logo for you and your company. Learn how to design a logo,
including identifying the essence of your brand and knowing what makes a
perfect logo, making the right design choices and managing the design process.

Here are the key steps to develop a
logo

Ask yourself: How do I design my own logo? Here are the
steps to follow:

Comprehend
that you need a logo. And why it must be perfect.

Business is just like dating — you're trying to attract the
right customers and make them fall in love with your brand. Think of your logo
as your dating profile image. It's what makes people curious and want to know
more about you (or swipe left because you're not for them).

You want to look your best, right?

Your logo will significantly affect your business' first
impression: it will give your customers knowledge about your brand and let them
know if it's right for them.

Since your logo is such an integral part of your brand, make
sure it's done well. All your branding products should include your logo.

Your website, packaging, and business cards should look back
at your clients. Make count! A perfect, competent logo design will not only
express what you stand for.

It will also make a strong first impression and help you
stand out.

Establish the identity

You want your logo to reflect your brand's personality. And
to do that, you must first recognize the core personality of your company.

When you have a good understanding of what makes you special
and what your brand is all about, making design choices that complement and
complete the image will be much easier.

Here are some questions to get to the bottom of your brand
identity:

·        
Why started this business?

·        
What beliefs and values are important to us as a
company?

·        
What's better than everyone else?

·        
What's making us special?

·        
If we could explain our brand in three words,
what 'd it be?

·        
What are the three words we want our customers
to describe?

Find inspiration for concept

Logo inspiration can be the toughest part of the design
process. Fortunately, we have some tips for you to make it quick.



Start a brainstorm

Maybe you're a visual individual and start gathering verbal
ideas.

A good brainstorming session can be just what you need to
pin down the look and feel you're trying to do.

Three steps to help you create the best artistic logo ideas:

Employ Brainstorm's
rules:

Brainstorming is about getting your ideas out (even the bad
ones) and writing down. Even a bad idea can spark a discussion leading to a
brilliant solution.

Think of your audience:

Create a list of words explaining the brand and how it is
viewed. Think like a person in your demographic target, and remember what's
important to them.

Engage everyone:

A one-person brainstorm is good, but only diversity can make
it happen. Bring people from every department, friends and business partners.
The better the chances.

When brainstorming the logo, don't be afraid to step out of
the box and be a little different.

See how creative logos like those for Crypto Caveman and
Nice Trip combine concepts you wouldn't normally associate with each other —
including cryptocurrencies and cavemen, or a honey bee and a pin on a map?
These logo options help them convey character and stand out from the crowd.

Create a frame

If you're a visual individual, a mood board can be the
perfect resource for inspiration. You may create an actual board by cutting and
pinning printed images or make a digital one (Pinterest is the obvious option
here).

Simply gather all the things you are attracted to — these
can be other badges, color variations, pictures or graphics, go wild! Your mood
board will show your gravitational style and design features in no time. Want a
good starting point? We recommend trying out the inspiration gallery logo
99designs.

Talk about visualizing your company in your logo. Simply
Rooted is all about seasonal, down-to-earth produce, and their vintage logo
represents that beautifully with hand-drawn root vegetables.

If you're searching for similar aesthetics, your mood board
can include photos of retro logos, painted drawings, organic shapes and colors.

Or look at how the Rugged logo visualizes their ""rugged""
brand identity in a bold, rough-looking word mark, but still includes a
luxurious gold-reflective vibe. Your mood board helps you to bring these
elements together.







Test the rivalry

The safest place to borrow ideas? Your contest! Check out
what's already out there for your audience and what you can stop. Think about
what makes them different from you when stalking those other companies, and how
you can highlight these differences in logo design.

Clearly differentiate yourself from your competition. If all
other businesses in your industry are going monochrome, you may have to opt out
for some color. If everyone else is traditional, a fun, modern logo can attract
attention.

Test the three logos above and how they express their brand
personalities. Orthrus Ventures' lion logo is traditional and reliable, while
Tidy Finance's logo looks sleek and cool. However, if it's fun and available,
let Hot Toast inspire you with its bright color and whimsical illustration.

Choose your look

Now that you have a simple brand concept and feel motivated,
it's time to start turning it into production.

Many different elements come into play here, from colors,
shapes and graphics to typography. Isolating each part and what it can do with
your logo can help you do things step-by-step, rather than being frustrated
with the whole design.

When thinking about your logo, the first thing you want to
do is choose the best aesthetic template for your brand. There's no style for
everybody, only what's best for your company.

Classics

Trendy logos can be fun and entertaining, but look outdated
quickly. A classic look gives you greater staying power and lets you reach a
wider audience.

This esthetic keeps things basic and doesn't venture into
wild palettes, textures, or fonts. A classic style shows people you're honest,
down to earth.

Retro and
antique

Vintage and retro style have been on the rise for quite some
time now.

They immediately remind you of the past, evoking nostalgic
nostalgia. A retro logo tells customers that tradition is relevant and that
everything you sell is done right.

Worn and hand-illustrated logos in brown and beige palettes
suit this beautiful aesthetic.

Modern, minimalist

Brands also choose a crisp, streamlined look to express
their freshness and modernity.

This style uses plenty of space, minimal detail and clear
lines, often resulting in sleek, pared back logos. A sleek and contemporary
design shows the consumers how up-to-date, trendy and knows what counts.

Fun and enjoyable

This is a common alternative for young (or young at heart)
target brands. Pleasant and quirky style appears to be colorful and humorous,
frequently using symbols or images to create a optimistic, friendly atmosphere.
Go for a whimsical mascot or sweet illustration to shine through your brand's
fun character.

Handmade,
made by hand

Handmade style carries a simple message: this brand is
individualistic and stands for handmade quality.

The design fits well with other styles, like retro, to
really bring the message home. But it can be combined with minimal and fun
styles for a simple, elegant or vivid, youthful look.

Can't pick one?

Naturally, these types aren't mutually exclusive: just mix
and match them to fit your brand. For example, your brand can be both handmade
and fun, just look at how the funky, illustrated logo for The Crafting Cactus
pulls it off.

1127,World update,Saudi Arabia stops executions for crimes committed by minors,"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 06:42:00 +0000",https://worldupdatedaily.blogspot.com/2020/04/saudi-arabia-stops-executions-for.html,"

Saudi Arabia won't enforce the death penalty on citizens who
committed crimes while still minors, says the country's Human Rights Committee.

The statement, citing King Salman's royal decree, comes two
days after the country said it 'd ban flying.

The UN Agreement on the Rights of the Child, signed by
Riyadh, states that capital punishment should not be used for minors' offenses.



Activists say Saudi Arabia has one of the world's worst
records on human rights.

They claim freedom of speech is seriously curtailed, and
government opponents are subject to arbitrary arrest.

In 2019, according to Amnesty International, a staggering
184 people were executed in the country. At least one case involved a man
convicted of a crime when he was a minor, the rights group said.

Saudi Arabia's record of 2019' reform and repression go hand
in hand in Saudi Arabia

Awwad Alawwad, president of the state-backed committee, said
a royal decree had replaced executions in situations where crimes were
committed by minors with a maximum sentence of 10 years in a juvenile detention
centre.

""The argument helps us build a more modern penal
code,"" Mr Alawwad said.



It was unclear when the decision-not immediately published
on state media-came into effect.

Following dramatic reforms, following the brutal
assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Istanbul Saudi Consulate in
2018, the Kingdom's human rights record remained under constant scrutiny,
although many civil rights and women's rights activists remain in jail.

Earlier this week, the most famous Saudi human rights
advocate died in jail after a stroke that fellow activists claim was caused by
authorities' medical negligence.

The news sent shockwaves through the political landscape, raising questions about the implications for Scottish politics and Sturgeon's leadership. In this article, we delve into the details surrounding the arrest controversy and examine its potential impact on Sturgeon's career and the broader political landscape in Scotland.The Alleged ArrestAccording to reports from various sources, Nicola Sturgeon was allegedly arrested in connection with undisclosed charges. However, it is essential to note that at the time of writing, these reports remain unconfirmed by official sources. The details surrounding the alleged arrest, including the nature of the charges and the circumstances leading up to it, remain speculative and subject to verification.Political ImplicationsIf the reports of Sturgeon's arrest are confirmed, it would undoubtedly have significant implications for Scottish politics. As the First Minister of Scotland and the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Sturgeon plays a prominent role in shaping the country's policies and advocating for Scottish independence. An arrest of this magnitude would undoubtedly cast a shadow over her leadership and potentially impact the SNP's standing.Legal Process and Presumption of InnocenceIt is crucial to remember that individuals are innocent until proven guilty, and Nicola Sturgeon deserves the presumption of innocence in this situation. Until official statements or legal proceedings confirm or refute the allegations, it is important to approach the situation with caution and avoid jumping to conclusions. The legal process should be allowed to unfold, ensuring a fair and impartial examination of the facts.Political Fallout and Public ConfidenceIn the event that the allegations against Nicola Sturgeon are substantiated, the political fallout could be significant. Such a development would likely impact public confidence in her leadership and raise questions about her ability to effectively govern. The SNP, as Scotland's leading political party, could face internal challenges in managing the fallout and potentially experience shifts in its political dynamics.Continued Focus on Governance and PoliciesRegardless of the outcome of these allegations, it is crucial to maintain focus on governance and policy matters in Scotland. The Scottish government, under Sturgeon's leadership, has been at the forefront of tackling various issues, including healthcare, education, and economic development. It is important that the government's commitment to serving the interests of the Scottish people remains steadfast and that policy initiatives are not overshadowed by the current controversy.ConclusionThe alleged arrest of Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has sparked controversy and raised questions about the future of Scottish politics. While the reports surrounding her arrest remain unconfirmed at this time, the potential implications for Sturgeon's leadership and the broader political landscape cannot be ignored. It is essential to allow the legal process to unfold and respect the presumption of innocence until official statements or legal proceedings provide clarity. In the meantime, the focus should remain on effective governance and addressing the pressing issues facing Scotland.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3207554272415662908.post-6048441691746976983","Breaking News, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon Arrest Controversy, Scottish politics",['Kashif'],"['Scottish', 'Scotland']","['Nicola Sturgeon', 'Sturgeon']","['SNP', 'the Scottish National Party']","[""Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon Arrest Controversy"", 'A Closer Look', 'the Developments', ""IntroductionScotland's First Minister"", 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'herself', 'controversy', 'reports', 'her alleged arrest', 'The news', 'shockwaves', 'the political landscape', 'questions', 'the implications', 'Scottish politics', ""Sturgeon's leadership"", 'this article', 'we', 'the details', 'the arrest controversy', 'its potential impact', ""Sturgeon's career"", 'the broader political landscape', 'Scotland', 'reports', 'various sources', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'connection', 'undisclosed charges', 'it', 'the time', 'these reports', 'official sources', 'The details', 'the alleged arrest', 'the nature', 'the charges', 'the circumstances', 'it', 'verification', 'the reports', ""Sturgeon's arrest"", 'it', 'significant implications', 'Scottish politics', 'the First Minister', 'Scotland', 'the leader', 'the Scottish National Party', 'SNP', 'Sturgeon', 'a prominent role', ""the country's policies"", 'Scottish independence', 'An arrest', 'this magnitude', 'a shadow', 'her leadership', ""the SNP's standing"", 'Legal Process', 'Presumption', 'InnocenceIt', 'individuals', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'the presumption', 'innocence', 'this situation', 'official statements', 'legal proceedings', 'the allegations', 'it', 'the situation', 'caution', 'conclusions', 'The legal process', 'a fair and impartial examination', 'the facts', 'Political Fallout', 'Public ConfidenceIn', 'the event', 'the allegations', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'the political fallout', 'Such a development', 'public confidence', 'her leadership', 'questions', 'her ability', 'The SNP', ""Scotland's leading political party"", 'internal challenges', 'the fallout', 'shifts', 'its political dynamics', 'Continued Focus', 'Governance', 'PoliciesRegardless', 'the outcome', 'these allegations', 'it', 'focus', 'governance and policy matters', 'Scotland', 'The Scottish government', ""Sturgeon's leadership"", 'the forefront', 'various issues', 'healthcare', 'education', 'economic development', 'It', ""the government's commitment"", 'the interests', 'the Scottish people', 'policy initiatives', 'the current controversy', 'ConclusionThe alleged arrest', ""Scotland's First Minister"", 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'controversy', 'questions', 'the future', 'Scottish politics', 'the reports', 'her arrest', 'this time', 'the potential implications', ""Sturgeon's leadership"", 'the broader political landscape', 'It', 'the legal process', 'the presumption', 'innocence', 'official statements', 'legal proceedings', 'clarity', 'the meantime', 'the focus', 'effective governance', 'the pressing issues', 'Scotland', 'Nicola Sturgeon', ""Scotland's First Minister"", ""Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon Arrest"", 'Scottish politics']"

1154,Breaking News,Australia Braces for an Intense Flu Season: What's Coming?,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:34:00 +0000",https://bbcstoriesnews.blogspot.com/2023/06/australia-braces-for-intense-flu-season.html," IntroductionAs the seasons change and winter approaches, Australia is gearing up to face a potentially severe flu season. Health authorities are closely monitoring the situation, urging citizens to take precautions and ensure they are adequately protected against the influenza virus. With rising concerns, it is crucial to understand the reasons behind the anticipated intensity of this year's flu season and how individuals can safeguard their health.A Looming ThreatAccording to recent reports from the Australian health sector, an intense flu season is on the horizon. The country is no stranger to seasonal influenza outbreaks, but the severity and impact of this year's flu strains have raised alarm bells among experts. Health officials have been observing an increase in flu-related hospitalizations and an alarming number of severe cases, leading to concerns about the potential strain on healthcare resources.Factors Contributing to IntensitySeveral factors are believed to contribute to the anticipated intensity of this year's flu season in Australia:Strain Variability: Influenza viruses are notorious for their ability to mutate rapidly, resulting in different strains emerging each year. This year, the dominant strains, such as influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B, are known for their potential to cause severe illness, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with compromised immune systems.Waning Immunity: The effectiveness of flu vaccines can diminish over time. If individuals fail to receive their annual vaccinations or if there is a mismatch between the circulating strains and the vaccine strains, population-level immunity may be reduced, leaving more people susceptible to infection.Interactions with COVID-19: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly influenced the global health landscape. While preventive measures like mask-wearing, social distancing, and increased hygiene practices have contributed to a decrease in flu cases, the easing of restrictions and potential complacency in adhering to these measures may create opportunities for the flu virus to spread.Protective MeasuresWith the anticipated intensity of the flu season, it is crucial for individuals to take proactive measures to protect themselves and limit the spread of the virus. Here are some recommended actions:Vaccination: Getting an annual flu shot remains the most effective way to reduce the severity and spread of the influenza virus. It is essential to consult with healthcare professionals to ensure eligibility and receive the appropriate vaccine for the prevailing strains.Hygiene Practices: Regularly washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using hand sanitizers when soap is unavailable, and avoiding touching the face are crucial in preventing the transmission of the flu virus.Respiratory Etiquette: Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing can help prevent the spread of respiratory droplets containing the virus.Social Distancing: Maintaining a safe distance from individuals showing flu-like symptoms and avoiding crowded spaces can significantly reduce the risk of contracting the virus.Seek Medical Attention: If flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue are experienced, individuals should seek medical advice and follow recommended treatment protocols.ConclusionAs Australia prepares to face an intense flu season, it is crucial for individuals to remain vigilant and take appropriate measures to protect their health and that of others. Vaccination, adherence to good hygiene practices, and following public health guidelines are essential components in mitigating the impact of the flu virus. By staying informed and proactive, we can collectively reduce the severity of the flu season and safeguard our communities.","tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3207554272415662908.post-3339108796799281842","A Looming Threat, Australia Braces for an Intense Flu Season: What's Coming?, Breaking News, COVID-19, H3N2, influenza B",['Kashif'],"['Australian', 'Australia']",[],[],"['Australia', 'an Intense Flu Season', 'What', 'the seasons', 'winter', 'Australia', 'a potentially severe flu season', 'Health authorities', 'the situation', 'citizens', 'precautions', 'they', 'the influenza virus', 'rising concerns', 'it', 'the reasons', 'the anticipated intensity', ""this year's flu season"", 'individuals', 'their health', 'recent reports', 'the Australian health sector', 'an intense flu season', 'the horizon', 'The country', 'no stranger', 'seasonal influenza outbreaks', 'the severity', 'impact', ""this year's flu strains"", 'alarm bells', 'experts', 'Health officials', 'an increase', 'flu-related hospitalizations', 'an alarming number', 'severe cases', 'concerns', 'the potential strain', 'healthcare resources', 'Factors', 'IntensitySeveral', 'factors', 'the anticipated intensity', ""this year's flu season"", 'Australia', 'Strain Variability', 'Influenza viruses', 'their ability', 'different strains', 'the dominant strains', 'influenza A(H3N2', 'influenza B', 'their potential', 'severe illness', 'vulnerable populations', 'young children', 'individuals', 'compromised immune systems', 'Waning Immunity', 'The effectiveness', 'flu vaccines', 'time', 'individuals', 'their annual vaccinations', 'a mismatch', 'the circulating strains', 'the vaccine strains', 'population-level immunity', 'more people', 'infection', 'Interactions', 'COVID-19', 'The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic', 'the global health landscape', 'preventive measures', 'mask-wearing', 'social distancing', 'increased hygiene practices', 'a decrease', 'flu cases', 'the easing', 'restrictions', 'potential complacency', 'these measures', 'opportunities', 'the flu virus', 'the anticipated intensity', 'the flu season', 'it', 'individuals', 'proactive measures', 'themselves', 'the spread', 'the virus', 'some recommended actions', 'Vaccination', 'an annual flu shot', 'the most effective way', 'the severity', 'spread', 'the influenza virus', 'It', 'healthcare professionals', 'eligibility', 'the appropriate vaccine', 'the prevailing strains', 'Hygiene Practices', 'hands', 'soap', 'water', 'at least 20 seconds', 'hand sanitizers', 'soap', 'the face', 'the transmission', 'the flu virus', 'Respiratory Etiquette', 'the mouth', 'nose', 'a tissue', 'elbow', 'the spread', 'respiratory droplets', 'the virus', 'a safe distance', 'individuals', 'flu-like symptoms', 'crowded spaces', 'the risk', 'the virus', 'Medical Attention', 'flu-like symptoms', 'fever', 'cough', 'sore throat', 'body aches', 'fatigue', 'individuals', 'medical advice', 'recommended treatment protocols', 'Australia', 'an intense flu season', 'it', 'individuals', 'appropriate measures', 'their health', 'that', 'others', 'Vaccination', 'adherence', 'good hygiene practices', 'public health guidelines', 'essential components', 'the impact', 'the flu virus', 'we', 'the severity', 'the flu season', 'our communities', 'Australia', 'an Intense Flu Season', 'What', 'COVID-19', 'H3N2', 'influenza B']"

We forget that it is something that needs maintenance.There are always considerations about what can be done better. Democracy has different meanings from country to country.Electoral College Not Found Anywhere ElseThe Electoral College, where votes are 'vonverted' into electors who then confirm a presidential election is something American. For the rest of us it seems less democratic that a state containing 10 electors means the winner gets ALL 10 electors when he wins over his opponent with even just ONE vote. Furthermore, the idea that you can go to court even after two or three recounts just as amazing.Similarly, there are many other special things. Even a country like Denmark looks in astonishment at debates in England. We have a tendency to have quiet majorities where people are locked in agreement circles based on previous votings. Once there is an area that is locked, it has to be opened, and decisions can only come into effect after a general election...Democracy IS a Special ThingDemocracy has its bad sides, but it is - after all - the best form of government thus far invented. We need people to be involved in maintaining a good democracy that is in constant development, based on learning about what works in neighbouring countries.What are YOUR thoughts, dear reader about democracy?--------------------------------

We saw what happened the last time he held the presidency, and the question is whether America will disqualify itself again?It doesn't matter whether we disagree on minor political aspects. That can be good grounds for sound debate. What does matter is the democratic foundation of no one being ABOVE the law. No one should be able to incite violence and remain unpunished!The January 6th Attack on CongressIt cannot be denied that the January 6th attack on Congress was disgraceful for America as a whole, and for the Republican party in particular.That anyone can defend Trump at a time when he faces criminal charges for incorrect bookkeeping of hush money based on quieting a case of adultery speaks VOLUMES about the moral crisis in the Republican party!People have been so screwed up after Trump had four years in the White House that they are almost afraid of saying what they SHOULD think about adultery. At a time when many senators and governors have opinions about the LGBTQ+ community, it smells of hipocrisy to attack homo- and bisexuals while defending adultery. How can the Republican party stand for family values when sexual misconduct is swept under the rug?Personally, I have the - probably liberal - value that I am not offended by the LGBTQ+ community. I have a family member who has left the closet, and I defend his right to stand on his own ground on this. I could never be offended by anyone's sexual preferences. Just as I don't understand the BDSM-community, but I don't talk down about things I don't understand. I try to get wiser, and I think we should all embrace knowledge.Hatred is all too often based on bigotry against things different from outselves, and it drains our energy. I won't be a part of that... :-)Trump Is NOT Worthy of the Office of President in AmericaTrump is not worthy of the office of President in America. That is a fact. He doesn't exhibit the values of decency and respect for others, and no one needs a narcissist to come back into the White House. Four years was more than enought, as I have written before in the article Will Republicans Grow Up Before 2024? and elsewhere on this blog. :-)--------------------------------

Furthermore, the United Kingdom got new Prime Ministers - plural. One lady won the competition promising things that ended up being destructive for their economy, and the other candidate who in fact warned that this would happen then got the baton. All culminating in former President Donald J Trump announcing he will run again in 2024...Politics Is an Insane BusinessIt is so insane once you begin thinking about what is going on in this world. We have never been as polarized as we are today - and that is really bad news because many of the global challenges require us to cooperate if we want to create lasting solutions.We need to realize how our politicians need to stop showing their egos, and need to start communicating with mutual respect with one another. Some of the current events can potentially end up in a very real world war - and that is so stupid when it is possible to avoid it if only world leaders would meet up and DO something that would be beneficial for all parties involved.Why Is World Peace So Difficult?Religious people would probably claim people need more religion, but that would be wrong. Many of the conflicts are in fact based on religious grudges between people. So religion in itself is no sure.There may be elements from religious thinking that could be useful, but we need to get politicians to meet without any preconceived ideas about the things they are forced to solve. The environment needs urgent attention, and conflicts need similar attention - yet none of this is as obvious for world leaders as it is for us lay-people....--------------------------------

1505,World Politics 101,The Overturn of Roe vs Wade,"Sat, 25 Jun 2022 03:59:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2022/06/the-overturn-of-roe-vs-wade.html,"The overturn of Roe vs Wade is being praised by so-called pro-life people. Let's be mindful that the right to choose NOT to complete a pregnancy IS an important aspect of equality - and now it was an important aspect of equality that is no longer available.I wrote this on Twitter:#America is losing the war on values. Being pro-choice is a matter of recognizing a woman's right to choose. Where is the responsibility of males who go spread their seed without ANY regard for the women? That is only VERY RARELY discussed. It's time the so-called pro-life 1/22/2 people grew up, and started to THINK for themselves instead of repeating antiquated one-liners as though they were automatically true decades after they were first uttered!How Can You Be Pro-Life and Support Gun Laws that KILL People?It is often said that the second ammendment is about the right to protect yourself, your family and your property. That was quite probably true decades ago. Now, people run around with semi-automatic assault riffles and powerful weapons that should ONLY be handled in a military setting with proper training BEFORE operating such weapons.Gun control is being called some of the worst things by people who fail in considering that there needs to be changes in the American society if school killings are to be stopped. It is no longer enough to repeat the same one-liners...The hipocrisy in America is so tragic to watch from a European perspective, because it indicates that something rotten is being overlooked by the policymakers in that country.When will they grow up???--------------------------------

The constitutional ammendment on bearing a firearm was never intended as an instrument of augmented weaponization. It was intended as a tool of self-defense in a country where law enforcement was often not just around the corner.Republicans Need to Join in a Bipartisan Effort to STOP This!Even though it was more than evident that Cruz and other Republicans were impotent at speaking up while Trump was ruling America, it's about time that they start to show the stamina that men such as Ronald Reagan and the Bush Presidents exhibited. America needs solutions, and not just Republican Senators playing smart with journalists.Time and time again, it's always increased security and metal detectors and numerous other things being discussed. Why is it never the tightening of controls so that people who clearly should NEVER have been approved as gunowners, simply won't ever get them?It's about time that politics starts dealing with solutions...--------------------------------

1507,World Politics 101,Important Lesson From the Ukraine Invasion,"Sun, 10 Apr 2022 07:48:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2022/04/important-lesson-from-ukraine-invasion.html,"Photo source: Sunday TimesWhen I see the atrocities being committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, it diminishes my hope for peace even once Putin is no longer in power. There seems to be some ""psychopathic gene"" in the way they will inflict pain on others just to survive.Decades of oppression under Communist dictatorship has instilled a bitterness and apathy that must be taken seriously if we want to understand why things aren't happening as we would expect from a western perspective.Let's Be Blunt!IF the events had happened in any other country, the people would have risen in a revolt. That is not the case in Russia. We see similar signs in Communist China where the people are scared to voice any disagreement with the regime.Putin should be stopped, but no one dares challenge his position - and the one man who leads the democratic opposition, Navalny, has been jailed on the basis of a conviction that appears to be more political than anything.Putin doesn't like ANY opposition. He is the very definition of communist thinking. Destroy the opposition, and suppress the people - a modern day Stalin, to say it bluntly...What Are the Odds of a Peaceful Solution?It is always dangerous to make any guesses, as everything depends upon what happens in the days and weeks ahead. But there IS a definite worry that Putin doesn't worry about what the rest of the world thinks. Just like ill-behaving thugs, he has no respect for democratic encouragement of peaceful negotiations. His dream of grandeur are his primary focus.He wants success at any cost, and I am quite sure he is angered by the fact that his military isn't anywhere as strong as he would like others to think. His 'empire' is slowly fading into the ground, and he might not stop at anything. He won't be ridiculed - and that is probably his most dangerous personality trait.Personally, I believe much changed when he divorced his first wife. I don't know the full story, but he has become cold as Siberian ice when it comes to staying in power. He is so insistant upon clinging to this presidency that one can worry as to how far this man will go to make that happen.These are dangerous times...--------------------------------

A question that is typical at the end of any year...Already, in the month of March, the world is faced with a Russian invasion of Ukraine. I think many of us were puzzled by the motivation of Russian President Vladimir Putin who claims this is an attempt at liberating Ukraine.None of us can see that need. We see this as an invasion, and now journalists are faced with long prison terms if they call this a war or an invasion. What should we call it, when another nation decides to 'take' control of another nation?We Were Hoping for World PeaceAs I wrote on my Danish blog, we were all hoping for peace. That the former contrast between East and West was 'a thing of the past'...We all knew that there were challenges and disagreements, but I don't think any of us saw this one coming.What were your thoughts, dear reader, about all of this? What did you think when you heard of this invasion? Please share.Personally, I had hoped we could reach a point of mutual respect even amid disagreements, and it bothers me that we have so many fora for international cooperation, and yet we can't seem to find ANY common ground. This is SO ridiculous in so many ways, and costs human lives both in the form of refugees, but certainly also people killed because we can't work out our differences in serious debate with each other.This begs the question: when will we grow up?--------------------------------

Now, a year later, the Republicans are still confused about how to handle the situation, as Donald J Trump still appears to be considering running again...WHY Do They Keep That Terrible Nightmare Alive?Many have speculated as to why they keep that terrible nightmare alive. Why haven't they taken a clear stand against lawlessness?We all know what would have happened if some important icons were still alive. I am obviously thinking of both former President Ronald Reagan and former Senator John McCain...None of these would have been silent if this thought had not been killed long ago.Lack of Courage?There needs to be a bit more courage in politics. The very fact that a lying bully creates his own social media - Truth Social - is ironic to keep it decent. Ridiculous at best when you consider the idea that Trump wants to create something so divisive. Much like East Germany was known as the 'German Democratic Republic' (DDR - Deutsche Demokratische Republik)... East Germany was anything but democratic.I am quite puzzled that Republicans haven't long ago said they would logically participate in a bipartisan quest for finding out how to avoid anything similar to that insurgence in 2021 ever could happen again. Peaceful transition of power has been one of the best parts of American democracy for centuries.There needs to be a clear decision made sometime in the near future if the Republicans want to be considered a credible party. That should be pretty obvious for all with eyes to see what the Trump years has done...Carpe diem! --------------------------------

America got a new President, a COP-meeting was held with somewhat disappointing results compared with what we all anticipated, and Afghanistan was left alone even after much energy had gone into initial training of their armed forces...We Need More Focus on Climate ChangeIt is no secret that we need more focus on climate change. Politicians are far too hesitant when it comes to developing policies that COULD actually make changes. It is so disappointing as we have seen many elections promise more action in later years. There is a huge gap between what is promised and what is actually being achieved.One can only wonder what would happen if we were faced with a war. Could politicians even wake up? I admit I may sound a little too skeptic, but being a realist involves saying things as I see them. Politics is all too much about creating illusions for being reelected, even though it would be far more effective to actually create results that you can then refer to in future elections. But most politicians lack the courage to stand up for what is evident for all others...I send the best seasonal greetings to all of you, hoping 2022 will be better.--------------------------------

It was a difficult war in so many ways. Namely because we only looked at it from a military perspective...Mujaheddin - Al Qaeda - ISIS - TalibanNo matter what name the bullies use, one thing remains obvious. Equal rights for all humans is not part of their vocabulary. In the west we value democracy - the idea that we all have a right to express our opinions in either writting or demonstrations. The Taliban doesn't have that kind of tolerance...In the west we also respect minorities. We don't discriminate just because people are different from ourselves. The Taliban doesn't have that kind of respect...Time Will Tell What HappensEven though we all value the idea of a more tolerant Taliban that has now declared that they will continue to allow women to get an education, it is doubtful whether that will actually be what happens in Afghanistan.The outlook when the Taliban could move on to the capital in mere weeks is bad. National military and police were obviously very poorly trained - and lacked stamina. So disappointing when the hope for a more modern Afghanistan was ALSO part of the whole package.Yesterday, President Biden spoke to the nation - and in an age of apps, in fact the whole world - claiming that his decision was the right one. He completed what former President Donald J Trump started, and that with hardly any changes to the plan. The twenty year limit was obviously more important than insisting upon testing the training of BOTH the Afghan police and military...May Very Well Cost Biden His Re-Election...It may not be popular to say this so soon into his first term, but if this type of decision-making is the level of 'expertise' for President Biden, he may very well become a one-term President. 2024 is not that far ahead, but I bet the Republicans will use this against him if - and when - Afghanistan falls apart.We should remember that in politics, appearance is everything!Facts don't matter much. We all know Republicans also wanted out of the war, but they will use this in their campaign for whomever they choose as their candidate in 2024. My only hope is that it isn't Donald Trump that they put on the scene again.--------------------------------

The former British PM Theresa May is no Margaret Thatcher. Her determination is not anyway near as solid as Mrs. Thatcher was in the eighties...Personally, I see German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a much stronger candidate, and since she is in her final term by her own choice, she would make an excellent candidate for the position as General Secretary of NATO.There is no doubt that Mrs. May has many talents, but I see her as fitting much better in an organization such as the UN. Her talents for long negotiations would fit much better in that framework.What are your thoughts, dear readers, on this? Your comment would be welcome.Wishing you all a good day. :-)--------------------------------

There is much to be done, and Mr. Biden won't have any time to slow down. 2017-2021 was terrible in many ways, and therefore the change happening when Joe Biden was sworn in on January 20th 2021 was so encouraging.You can watch his first State of the Union address by clicking here: https://youtu.be/dggKaPXt0gIHope RevitalizedThe Republicans may have much to say, and we know what Trump would say. But when you get down to the real business, now is the time to enjoy the hope that was revitalized when all can now see a President that takes his responsibility seriously.Wishing you all a very good day. :-)--------------------------------

There is so much to be appreciative of, for the American people.Ranging from re-entering the WHO to the vaccines actually being administered, there is hope ahead for America as a superpower once again.The End of One Era - The Beginning of AnotherIn so many ways it feels nice to actually write a positive article about American politics. It's been so long since there was something positive to write.I also fully realize that there is a lot of rebuilding to be done before we are back to the normal levels of diplomatic respect America enjoyed before 2017, but I found it necessary to be grateful for the fact that the process has finally begun.What are your thoughts, dear readers?--------------------------------

1515,World Politics 101,Incitement to Violence From a Sitting President - Who Saw That Coming?,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 06:16:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2021/01/incitement-to-violence-from-sitting.html,"Even the most sensation-prone authors of movie scripts could never have guessed this one. Incitement to violence and rebellion IS illegal, and there is no way around it. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have already removed numerous updates from Donald Trump who is about to destroy his legacy with his lack of acknowledgment that Joe Biden won the election in November.Even the most fervent Trump supporters can't be this foolish...Apparently some are, and some of these people stormed Capitol Hill wednesday. A shocking display of violence and stupidity, and truly a very bad way of ending a Presidency - even for someone like Donald Trump.Violence Is NEVER Any Solution!At a time when people around the Trump administration are leaving ship, some are still adamant in insisting on a wrong conclusion. There is no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing during the elections, even though some fans have their heads up their behinds to an extent that they will do ANYTHING to keep Donald Trump in office, totally disregarding any evidence of the facts as 'fake news'...If you haven't already read my two previous articles on this subject, namely Democracy 101 - Will Republicans and Democrats Face Up to Fundamentals of Any Democracy? and Polarization, Anecdotal Evidence and the Lack of Unity in Societies, I recommend you do that at your earliest convenience. This is important!Time will tell what happens in these final weeks before Inauguration Day when President-Elect Joe Biden is sworn in as the next President. No one can anticipate the next steps of bullies, and it is a huge task of reuniting America. It has become a hugely polarized society, and we need a strong America to be the beacon of light amidst a dark world. Being such a beacon requires common sense to come back at the centre of people's minds. I do hope that happens when the next President comes into office.A constitutional ammendment may have to deal with this type of scenario, and I am confident, the coming President is very much aware of the need to take into account what should happen if anyone even remotely as crazy as Donald Trump ever comes into office in the future... Wishing all readers a good day. :-)--------------------------------

1516,World Politics 101,Finally the EU Is Starting to Show Some Stamina Towards Anti-Democratic Forces,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:33:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/12/finally-eu-is-starting-to-show-some.html," It is a great pleasure to hear that the EU is starting to show some stamine towars anti-democratic forces. When nations get support money from the EU, it will now be a defining term whether national governments respect the rights of minority groups.This has been far too long in the waiting. When many East European nations were accepted into the EU, it was criticised that many of these nations did not respect their minorities. We have waited far too many years to see that come into effect, and Poland, Hungary, Romania etc have all had their issues ranging from the size of prison cells to acceptance of sexual minorities.It's a Matter of DecencySocieties are known by how they treat their weakest citizens. This is highly important as a united EU should equal respect for freedoms of speech, belief, race etc. If you have hateful people in a society, it always ends up in discord, and all the people suffer when minorities suffer.Far too many have too little respect for this important aspect in many societies.I have never understood that property in some humans. Personally, I believe in tolerance towards all people. It doesn't matter that some have opinions I may disagree with. I can still act decently towards such people in full respect of their right to live as they wish.Freedoms for Everyone Doesn't Take Away Our Own FreedomThis is such an important lesson for all of us in these times. No one wins when ethnic minorities can't live peacefully as they wish, and I don't lose anything from respecting them, do I?Therefore, it is so positive that the EU now takes this seriously. We all knew some nations would protest against this, but if that was their position when they entered, they should never have applied for membership. It IS a total no go to look the other way when nations don't live up to the ideals of the EU. We want a peaceful continent where all can abide on equal terms, so I fully applaud this clear signal from Brussels.--------------------------------

1517,World Politics 101,"Polarization, Anecdotal Evidence and the Lack of Unity in Societies","Mon, 30 Nov 2020 07:52:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/11/polarization-anecdotal-evidence-and.html,"We live in a polarized world. If someone states something that is unpopular, you can be sure it will get a lot of flack on #SoMe. It isn't a question of people asking based on a source that says something different, or asking honest questions, but quite simply an anger that you don't agree with them.It isn't 'just' in response to recent elections, but unfortunately a general trend that is affecting all among us. Put a corona lockdown on top of a polarized debate culture, and you have a highly explosive cocktail.The Need For Double Checking EvidenceThere has always been a need for double checking evidence. Rhetorically speaking there has always been certain tricks you can play to make a speech or an article more convincing. Anecdotal evidence is one of them. Once you can put a name and a background to an opinion, it will move people.This is the type of 'evidence' people use to stir up anger, and is often seen when people want to introduce people to an idea about a demonstration. Once you can convince them that some type of wrongdoing has been done, you can really get people fired up.We need to double check such facts BEFORE we react.Often Hidden Frustrations Behind EmotionsOnce you have worked with people that show a tendency to angry reactions, you will recognize that there are often hidden frustrations behind those emotions. The lack of balance is caused by a lack of staying on neutral ground.If you don't FULLY agree with them, you are part of the problem because THEY know they are right...You can't work with that. If you try to treat the symptom without finding the root cause to begin with, your efforts will be in vain.And, even worse, social media platforms have intensified the tendency towards a more polarized society. It all begins on a personal level, yet spreads like a wildfire. If you have any doubts about this, and the effects of algorithms have in all of this, you should watch The Social Dilemma on Netflix.Stay Focused on Unifying Rather Than DividingMy best advice is to stay focused on unifying rather than dividing. We can break the algorithm trends when we make it a priority to stay focused on sharing positive news rather than letting algorithms ruin our mental stability. The whole world needs positive news in this time with a global pandemic, and it's about time someone called the bluff. :-)--------------------------------

1518,World Politics 101,Democracy 101 - Will Republicans and Democrats Face Up to Fundamentals of Any Democracy?,"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 04:35:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/10/democracy-101-will-republicans-and.html,"It is so tragic to read the article on Huffington Post about both sides preparing for legal battles in connection with elections on November 3rd. It doesn't matter who you are voting for. American democracy is sick, and there are not that many who call the bluff on BOTH sides.Everybody knows Trump will do anything to stay in power, and everybody knows Biden will do anything he can for the popular vote to have a consequence if he wins.On the surface that is very understandable.As I indicated in my article about the Electoral College written in January of 2020, there is a systemic lack of balance in the way both sides debate about the fundamental problems in the system. This is an issue that needs to be addressed IF politicians want to regain a respect for democracy.We cannot have discussions about whether mail ballots must be counted. Each voting American citizen deserves to be heard, and no one should doubt the legitimacy of people choosing to vote by mail during a pandemic.When a sitting President encourages people to vote twice, as he did about a month ago, he is suggesting something that could be illegal. This is very serious business, and should strike anyone with a democratic mindset to be shocked by such a suggestion.Wishing all a good election day. It will be interesting to see both the result, and certainly also how that result will be treated by both parties.Have a nice weekend. :-)--------------------------------

1519,World Politics 101,Presidential Debates - What to Anticipate in Coming Events,"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 11:01:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/10/presidential-debates-what-to-anticipate.html,"The first presidential debate between current POTUS Donald J Trump and Democratic candidate and former VP Joe Biden was a travesty. I wanted to wait a few days before expressing any opinions on the matter in an attempt to let things settle, before speaking on the subject. That break has only made things even more clear than ever before.The current President interrupted Joe Biden so many times that I truly felt sorry for Chris Wallace as moderator. He had a tough job there, and considering he at least tried twice to remind Mr. Trump of the agreement to let the opponent speak, things could have been even worse with a man like Trump who already showed an ugly tendency towards bullying when he met Hillary Clinton in 2016.I Had Expected More of a Sitting PresidentI know I sound a bit old when I remind people of the good old days when Ronald Reagan was President. Let's be frank about this. He was charged with being too old, and replied that he wouldn't hold the opponent's young age against him. That was a rebuttal with some class, at least... :-)Today, charges are made that should NEVER have made it into any presidential debate. One example is the use of Joe Biden's son's former drug addiction against him. IF Donald Trump was just half the family man he claims to be, he should have been better than this. We all know it's one big reality show for Donald Trump, but if we even gave him the benefit of doubt that his family relations aren't only show for the audience, he should have kept away from such an attack.You will never see an apology from Trump. He has too big an ego for such a thing, but it would have been the only honorable thing to do. How anyone from church-related groups can accept such behavior in a candidate for re-election is simply beyond my comprehension - and I consider myself to be a man of average intelligence. :-)IF America Re-Elects Trump It's Bound to Get Even WORSE!Truth be told there is a grave danger that this type of bullying will continue if the American people re-elects this man.Mark those words in your memory, because history has some lessons in that statement.Back in 2016, people claimed Donald Trump would get milder once he was sworn in as President in January of 2017. The exact opposite happened. The man who earned millions from media outlets showing The Apprentice continued to treat his new office as his own little podium for screaming ""You're fired!""Every reasonable man or woman who has ever criticised Trump has seen the anger from this man. People who were applauded as almost God's gift to the office when chosen were ostracised as poisonous and incompetent people once he could not get their full and unconditional approval...That should speak volumes for anyone even remotely considering to vote for Trump on November 3rd...You cannot trust a man who shifts so much in his temper tantrums for so many years. That he has sociopathic tendencies should come as no surprise to normal thinking people. The office of President of the United States of America is no platform for hatred and division - yet it has become exactly that since Mr. Trump was sworn in on January 20th 2017.One Month From TodayIn exactly one month, the decision is up to the people.On October 7th, VP Mike Pence will meet VP candidate Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City in Utah. On October 15th and 22nd, President Trump will meet Presidential candiate Joe Biden. Those three debates will be essential in establishing who should hold the office after January 20th 2021.Even though Mr. Trump and his wife have shown no kindness to anyone that dared disagree with them, one can only hope they will recover from the coronavirus disease. I and many others have openly stated our best wishes for their speedy recovery, even though we have no anticipation that even such a dangerous disease gives them any reason to reconsider their behavior if Mr. Trump was re-elected on November 3rd.I will not debase myself to the level of ever stating openly what I could have wished for him. I simply don't operate on that level, and I fully agree with the former State Secretary Hillary Clinton when she said ""when they go low, we go high"". Leave the rest to karma. The law of good or bad karma has its own modus operandi - and it can strike very hard for a man who has cheated, lied, back-stabbed and ridiculed everyone around him...Wishing all readers a happy weekend. :-)--------------------------------

1520,World Politics 101,Just Over A Month to Election Day in America,"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 02:59:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/09/just-over-month-to-election-day-in.html,"While most are acutely aware of the numerous tweets from the sitting President, Donald Trump, it is high time to call the bluff about mail ballots.If Trump was ahead in the polls, he wouldn't be talking about this, but he is so focused on words like cheating, fake, crooked and other negative words that people are growing tired of hearing about these elections...The good news is that it is soon over. November 3rd is just around the corner. 38 days to be precise.Even in the unlikely even that Trump achieves re-election, it would at least be the final term. The American constitution is clear about that, even though Trump has suggested running for a third term, much like the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has ruled Russia for decades. But one thing is the rhetoric - the constitution won't be changed any time soon.There may well be readers of this blog that vote for Trump. I fully respect that. I value all readers, regardless of their opinions. I would, however, be happy if some of such proponents would be so kind as to explain in the comments field how they can relate the lies and badmouthing with traditional Republican values. I am curious as to how anyone can overlook the double-speak from the lips of sitting President Trump...Regardless of political opinions, there are valid reasons for wanting to vote by mail. When you are in the middle of a pandemic, standing in long rows while waiting to vote is not the optimal decision. Staying away from gathering in large crowds IS the only sensible thing, especially for people who could be hit even harder by the corona virus. Wishing all readers a happy weekend.--------------------------------

1521,World Politics 101,Chinese Bullying Totally Unacceptable!,"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 04:44:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/07/chinese-bullying-totally-unacceptable.html,"Regular readers of this blog on politics may remember I wrote about The Hong Kong Crisis in August 2019. Since then China has continued to show a very sharp knife towards Hong Kong. Even though there is a promise of local autonomy until 2047, it's starting to show that China wants to remove any and all special status regulations BEFORE 2047. In light of this, the UK administration cancelled their extradition agreement with Hong Kong for the obvious reason that Hong Kong can no longer be considered an independent area with sound rules of law and order in a democratic spirit.This has enraged China, who has now threatened that this action will have consequences as China reserves the right to consider this an 'internal matter'...The Rule of LawOne of the most important elements in democracy is that you treat people decently and correctly, regardless of whether you agree with them. That has not always been the recipe for the Chinese government.In fact, the massacre on Tiananmen Square in 1986 was the first event that really sparked my interest for politics. I was 16 at the time. Seeing a government opposing demonstration in such a violent manner was a travesty to any and all democratic thoughts. The events in Hong Kong only add fuel to that fire...Bullying Tactics Won't Succeed!Threatening the UK with 'consequences' is no way to treat the United Kingdom. An agreement was signed in 1997, and even though the current Chinese government may disagree with promises made, a gentleman's agreement must be honored by both parties involved.The Chinese may believe they can win by closing imports of British products, and they may even threaten countries that sympathize with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but that tactic won't work either. All countries need to start building on the original principles of the United Nations.Co-operation beats bullying at any and all times, and it is a major concern that the Chinese haven't understood this. Tibet is a case in point. Chinese has much explaining to do, and even though we only rarely see the United Nations speaking in ALL-CAPITALS to the Chinese, there is a limit to what we can all accept in terms of democracy and the freedom of the people...Have a nice day.--------------------------------

1522,World Politics 101,Wishing the People of Poland a Happy Election Day,"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 22:01:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/06/wishing-people-of-poland-happy-election.html,"Today is Election Day in Poland. It will be interesting to see how the people of Poland will vote today. As a member state in Europe it would be preferable if they chose a leadership that is willing to invest in being part of the European Union. Rumor has it that the ultra right-wing nationals are leading in the polls, and that is rather sad when seen from a European perspective.Peace requires all nations to come together, and countries such as Hungary, Austria, Romania and Poland have each their animosity towards Brussels and Strassbourg. I wrote the following tweet this morning:Well, IF Poland wants a Poland-first agenda, they should also begin financing it. Sorry guys, we love your country, and it's so sad to see ultra right-wing candidates disrespect the brotherhood of the EU to spread hate and intolerance. This is not the road to peace and growth! [link to tweet: https://twitter.com/henrikblunck/status/1276747578617495552?s=20]Poland - A Nation That Has Lost Its Historical UnderstandingIn my view, and I know some may disagree, I think it is important to remember where they were before the Berlin Wall came down. As a satelite nation under Soviet Communism, it suffered greatly until Mikhail Gorbachov came on the scene.When Solidarity rose as a popular movement, things began to change, and Poland is one of the nations who has enjoyed great economic growth from the European Union. That sense of gratitude is somewhat disregarded when politicians claim homosexuality is worse than Communism.Not only is that view intolerant, it is also highly ahistoric when compared with what actually happened until the Berlin Wall came down three decades ago.I fully recognize that as a Dane I don't have any say in what the Polish people choose to do on Election Day. But I do hope the polls are wrong, as I do think we should have greater tolerance towards all people all over the European continent. It is easy to agree with people with whom you fully agree, but we need more tolerance in a European Union where 27 nations need to co-exist with all their national differences at least aligned with common ground and tolerance at the forefront.We can do so much more when we work TOGETHER, and even though many nationalistic movements try to speak a 'Brexit-agenda' in the belief that standing alone was somehow better, I think most people can acknowledge that this is a both naïve and false claim...Happy Election Day to all. :-)--------------------------------

1523,World Politics 101,The New Book by John Bolton - Helped by Trump Attempt to Stop It,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:22:00 +0000",https://world-politics-101.blogspot.com/2020/06/the-new-book-by-john-bolton-helped-by.html,"The book The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir by former National Security Advisor John Bolton is probably being preordered at a steady pace now that Trump has tried to stop the publication of this book.It is quite funny that a Donald Trump, who only won his presidency because of a majority in the Electoral College, while losing in the popular vote with at least three million votes, who has called every single member of his cabinet ""wonderful"" when chosen and ""awful, bad etc"" when removed, is spending time trying to stop a book that claims to reveal issues in his administration.When You Act Emotionally, You Stop Thinking RationallyIt is a given that Donald Trump is ruled by his emotions. If he had spent just a few short moments thinking rationally, he would have realized that every single book about him were boosted by his antagonism. He boosted an increasing demand by his fear of being ridiculed.He has done so every single time he is faced with someone who disagrees in ANY form with his administration. When I wrote this article entitled Politics Is Getting Nastier By the Day only a few days after his inauguration, little did I realize it would be almost prophetic in the comparison with Francis Underwood in House of Cards.We have seen how crazy Trump has acted in his first term, and that begs the question: what will happen IF he were to gain a second term?The aspects of that question are not fun anymore. It is serious business, and restructuring The White House will be a huge task for a new President. Respect for democracy is at an all-time low. Donald Trump has destroyed every aspect of the office by his angry tweets, and this needs to be restored for America to come back to its former glory.--------------------------------

It is a travesty against justice when people are treated badly by any police force. It was so true when one of the chief speakers said that for each of these terrible five minutes, the assisting policemen COULD have intervened. When they didn't, they were indeed part of the problem...President Trump never quite understood what happened. Focus was immediately cast on looters and violent demonstrators, but those actions were only a result of a systemic problem. Nobody agrees with looting or demonstrating with violence. It goes WITHOUT saying!What the President should have recognized was that there IS a need to investigate and reform who we give a badge to. There ARE people who simply can't handle being given power. They use it against their own people, and don't handle situations according to their severity, but in some cases over-react.This is not just an American problem. All nations can recognize that this is a global problem.There ought to be a psychologic profile of each and every policeman, regardless of color or age. A police badge must only be given to a person that understands the importance of ALWAYS acting according to law. All democratic nations need a task force that is automatically involved when people are hurt during arrests or during incarceration.Even the appearance of any evil could be avoided if everybody knew that they would have to face a board each time they use excessive power. It SHOULD be something that would be applauded by the police officers themselves, as this would also increase their authority and respect in societies all over the world.Many will quench this by their own agendas. They are talking off-topic because they won't recognize the need to change current behavior, and that is a shame, because then these awful actions will just be repeated.Democracy requires of all of us that we respect law and order, and that requires us all to behave decently, even when stopping criminals. Any less is a breach with the fundamentals of democracy.I wish all readers a good weekend. :-)--------------------------------

Even a first semester journalism student can see through many of the arguments, but many are - unfortunately - not even paying any attention to the potential damage that sharing false information can have on the presidential elections in November.It doesn't matter whether it's big or small news. A lot of little nuggets of error can, when combined, become a very poor image. Try solving a puzzle with the same lack of care and attention... 😇You Should Test All Things - Both SidesEven though it may be tempting to trust information that aligns with your personal opinions, you still need to be mindful that information can be colored by bias.The only way to avoid being cheated into sharing false information is to test all things. It will take more time. But you might want to change your perspective, so you can focus on never being involved with sharing false information.When claims are made, check it.The Good News Is That False Information You Don't Share Can't Convince OthersIn a time where bots are used to spread information, the good news is that such false information can't convince others if it isn't shared.A lot of money is being pushed into social media campaigns to avoid the careful scrutiny of editors in traditional media such as newspapers and television news networks, and therefore we can all conclude that it is an effective channel for influencing people. But you don't have to make it any worse by helping people share falsehoods.It is a new way of thinking in politics, and we need to be prepared because this is spreading all over the globe.Have a nice week. :-)--------------------------------

Just like doctors should stay away from politics, so politicians should stay away from playing doctors!


No one wants to overlook a pandemic that costs thousands of lives. However, some of them clearly didn't take it seriously enough!

This is serious business, and should definitely become a part of crisis handling in all countries. We need clear guidelines all over the world as even statesmen get infected. Most recently UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson...

Most surprisingly, even  a Corona pandemic couldn't wake up the American President Donald Trump. He just throws around a few numbers and guesses/hopes US fatalities could stay below 200,000. It seems so strange to be living in a world where a fool is running The White House. I am actually sorry that world politics is in this limbo while Trump rules, but all sense of normal has been disabled since 2017 at so many levels.

We can only look forward to the day when this pandemic is over, and then that Trump is voted out in November at the American elections.--------------------------------

But on Monday, ABC’s Good Morning America scoffed at the facts, backed up by police and witnesses, that Neely was threatening to kill women and children on the train that day. Instead, they painted Penny as the violent attacker.

“The former Marine is facing manslaughter charges for the chokehold death of a homeless man on the subway,” proclaimed liberal shill and co-host George Stephanopoulos before going to correspondent DeMarco Morgan for the details.

Morgan rhetorically scoffed at Penny’s account while painting him as attacking Neely out of nowhere:


And in the taped interview, Penny says he was not only concerned about his own life that day, but for the women and children who were on that train as well.

[Cut to video]

This morning, former Marine Daniel Penny, charged with manslaughter in the death of Jordan Neely after holding him in a chokehold on this New York City subway, is speaking out for the first time about that fatal encounter.


 





 

“The three main threats that he repeated over and over was: ‘I’m going to kill you,’ ‘I’m prepared to go to jail for life,’ and ‘I am willing to die,’” Penny explained to the reasonable who would listen to him. “I was scared for myself, but I looked around and I saw women and children. He was yelling in their faces saying – saying these threats. I couldn’t just sit still.”

Despite the corroborating accounts of other witnesses, Morgan was skeptical. “Penny claims he was intimidated by Neely, who he says boarded the train and began yelling in passengers’ faces,” he said. Of course, he omitted Neely’s history of assaulting people on the subway.

“Video of the encounter shows Penny holding Neely in the chokehold on the floor of the subway until he stops moving,” Morgan added, omitting the fact that there was another man, who happened to be black, helping Penny restrain Neely.

Penny also dispelled the lies many in the liberal media and on the left had been spreading about him, including claims of racism:


Some people say I was holding onto Mr. Neely for 15 minutes. That is not true. I mean, between stops is only a couple of minutes. And so the whole interaction was less than 5 minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death, which is also not true. I was trying to restrain him. I didn’t see a black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers. A lot of whom were people of color.


Only as he neared the end of his report did Morgan admit that police confirm that “Neely was harassing other passengers and making threats.” But he immediately tried to blunt the truth by suggesting Neely was simply “a former street performer who often impersonated Michael Jackson"" who ""had a history of mental illness and homelessness.”

ABC’s Good Morning America
June 12, 2023
8:32:18 a.m. Eastern

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And now we’re going to get the latest on Daniel Penny. The former Marine is facing manslaughter charges for the chokehold death of a homeless man on the subway. He’s speaking out for the first time. DeMarco Morgan is here with the story. Good morning DeMarco.

DEMARCO MORGAN: Good morning, to you. He is breaking his silence. This latest video was released rather by Daniel Penny’s attorneys. And in the taped interview, Penny says he was not only concerned about his own life that day, but for the women and children who were on that train as well.

[Cut to video]

This morning, former Marine Daniel Penny, charged with manslaughter in the death of Jordan Neely after holding him in a chokehold on this New York City subway, is speaking out for the first time about that fatal encounter.

DANIEL PENNY: The three main threats that he repeated over and over was: ‘I’m going to kill you,’ ‘I’m prepared to go to jail for life,’ and ‘I am willing to die.’

MORGAN: Penny claims he was intimidated by Neely, who he says boarded the train and began yelling in passengers’ faces.

PENNY: I was scared for myself, but I looked around and I saw women and children. He was yelling in their faces saying – saying these threats. I couldn’t just sit still.

MORGAN: Video of the encounter shows Penny holding Neely in the chokehold on the floor of the subway until he stops moving.

PENNY: Some people say I was holding onto Mr. Neely for 15 minutes. That is not true. I mean, between stops is only a couple of minutes. And so the whole interaction was less than 5 minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death, which is also not true. I was trying to restrain him.

I didn’t see a black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers. A lot of whom were people of color.

MORGAN: According to police, Neely was harassing other passengers and making threats but was not physically violent.

Neely, a former street performer who often impersonated Michael Jackson had a history of mental illness and homelessness.

The incident sparked protests around the city as his family and the Manhattan district attorney’s office called for Penny’s arrest.

[Cuts back to live]

MORGAN: Now, Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter last month and released on bond. The case in now before a grand jury. And Jordan Neely’s attorneys have yet to comment.",279125,,['Nicholas Fondacaro'],"['Manhattan', 'Marine', 'New York City']","['Jordan Neely', 'MORGAN', 'Penny', 'Jordan Neely’s', 'Morgan', 'Neely', 'George Stephanopoulos', 'DeMarco', 'GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:', 'DEMARCO MORGAN', 'DANIEL PENNY', 'Daniel Penny', 'Michael Jackson', 'PENNY', 'Daniel Penny’s', 'DeMarco Morgan']","['ABC', 'Ancestry', 'Macy’s']","['ABC', 'Fact', 'Jordan Neely', 'Women', 'Children', 'an interview', 'his lawyers', 'former Marine and good Samaritan, Daniel Penny', 'the first time', 'his account', 'the incident', 'that', 'the death', 'Jordan Neely', 'a violent and mentally disturbed homeless man', 'Monday', 'ABC’s Good Morning America', 'the facts', 'police', 'witnesses', 'Neely', 'women', 'children', 'the train', 'they', 'Penny', 'the violent attacker', 'The former Marine', 'manslaughter charges', 'the chokehold death', 'a homeless man', 'the subway', 'liberal shill', 'co', '-', 'host', 'George Stephanopoulos', 'correspondent DeMarco Morgan', 'the details', 'Morgan', 'Penny’s account', 'him', 'Neely', 'the taped interview', 'Penny', 'he', 'his own life', 'the women', 'children', 'who', 'that train', 'video', 'former Marine Daniel Penny', 'manslaughter', 'the death', 'Jordan Neely', 'him', 'a chokehold', 'this New York City subway', 'the first time', 'that fatal encounter', 'The three main threats', 'that', 'he', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'jail', 'life', 'I', 'Penny', 'who', 'him', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'women', 'children', 'He', 'their faces', 'these threats', 'I', 'the corroborating accounts', 'other witnesses', 'Morgan', 'Penny', 'he', 'Neely', 'who', 'he', 'the train', 'passengers’ faces', 'he', 'he', 'Neely’s history', 'people', 'the subway', 'Video', 'the encounter', 'Penny', 'Neely', 'the chokehold', 'the floor', 'the subway', 'he', 'Morgan', 'the fact', 'another man', 'who', 'Penny', 'Neely', 'Penny', 'the lies', 'the liberal media', 'the left', 'him', 'claims', 'racism', 'Some people', 'I', 'Mr. Neely', '15 minutes', 'That', 'I', 'stops', 'only a couple', 'minutes', 'the whole interaction', 'less than 5 minutes', 'Some people', 'I', 'him', 'death', 'which', 'I', 'him', 'I', 'a black man', 'passengers', 'I', 'a man', 'passengers', 'A lot', 'whom', 'people', 'color', 'he', 'the end', 'his report', 'Morgan', 'police', 'Neely', 'other passengers', 'threats', 'he', 'the truth', 'Neely', 'a former street performer', 'who', 'Michael Jackson', 'who', 'a history', 'mental illness', 'homelessness', 'ABC’s dismissal', 'Daniel Penny’s evidence-backed account', 'lucrative sponsorships', 'Ancestry', 'Macy', 'Their contact information', 'The transcript', 'ABC’s Good Morning America', 'GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', 'we', 'Daniel Penny', 'The former Marine', 'manslaughter charges', 'the chokehold death', 'a homeless man', 'the subway', 'He', 'the first time', 'DeMarco Morgan', 'the story', 'Good morning', '\n\nDEMARCO MORGAN', 'you', 'He', 'his silence', 'This latest video', 'Daniel Penny’s attorneys', 'the taped interview', 'Penny', 'he', 'his own life', 'the women', 'children', 'who', 'that train', 'video', 'former Marine Daniel Penny', 'manslaughter', 'the death', 'Jordan Neely', 'him', 'a chokehold', 'this New York City subway', 'the first time', 'that fatal encounter', '\n\nDANIEL PENNY', 'The three main threats', 'he', 'I', 'you', 'I', 'jail', 'life', 'I', 'MORGAN', 'Penny', 'he', 'Neely', 'who', 'he', 'the train', 'passengers’ faces', 'PENNY', 'I', 'myself', 'I', 'I', 'women', 'children', 'He', 'their faces', 'these threats', 'I', 'MORGAN', 'Video', 'the encounter', 'Penny', 'Neely', 'the chokehold', 'the floor', 'the subway', 'he', 'PENNY', 'Some people', 'I', 'Mr. Neely', '15 minutes', 'That', 'I', 'stops', 'only a couple', 'minutes', 'the whole interaction', 'less than 5 minutes', 'Some people', 'I', 'him', 'death', 'which', 'I', 'him', 'I', 'a black man', 'passengers', 'I', 'a man', 'passengers', 'A lot', 'whom', 'people', 'color', 'MORGAN', 'police', 'Neely', 'other passengers', 'threats', 'Neely', 'a former street performer', 'who', 'Michael Jackson', 'a history', 'mental illness', 'homelessness', 'The incident', 'protests', 'the city', 'his family', 'the Manhattan district attorney’s office', 'Penny’s arrest', 'Penny', 'second-degree manslaughter', 'bond', 'The case', 'a grand jury', 'Jordan Neely’s attorneys', 'None']"
1579,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Republicans Should Just Say No to NBC! They Aren’t Fair Debate Moderators,"June 12th, 2023 1:34 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/geoffrey-dickens/2023/06/12/republicans-should-just-say-no-nbc-they-arent-fair-debate,"With more candidates jumping into the GOP race last week, decisions on which news outlets get to host the Republican primary debates should be coming soon. 

Back on June 2, Axios reported NBC, led by Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, made a hard pitch to the RNC (back in February) to moderate one of the GOP primary debates to be presumably broadcast on NBC, MSNBC or CNBC.

However, the Axios story also reported Florida Republican Governor Ron Desantis has “been pushing back against” NBC hosting a GOP debate and with good reason given “MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell acknowledged using ‘imprecise’ language….that implied DeSantis didn’t want slavery taught in schools.” 

It’s not just DeSantis who should be wary of NBC unfairly rigging the debates. Every GOP presidential hopeful may want to think twice before accepting an invite to an NBC produced debate. 

A review of the MRC’s archives shows a consistent and clear pattern of slanted questions to Republican candidates. 

Any 2023 debate is sure to include current White House correspondent and incoming host of NBC’s Meet the Press Kristen Welker. When Welker moderated a 2020 presidential debate she hit then-incumbent President Donald Trump and Vice President Biden with tough questions on immigration, race issues and crime — but all from the left:

 Welker to Trump: 


“Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?”


Welker to Biden: 


“The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?”


 Welker to Trump: 


“We’re going to continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you’ve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You’ve said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?”


Welker to Biden: 


“Crime bills that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?


That was bad, but the most obnoxious moderator behavior came in the GOP primary debates. These should be forums for Republican voters to learn about differing candidate positions before they vote in their state primaries, but instead NBC’s moderators turned these events into their own personal platforms to smack down GOP politicians and their conservative policies. 

The following is a compilation of the agenda-driven, one-sided and just plain rude questions NBC’s debate moderators have asked GOP presidential candidates over the years:

 





 

A look at NBC’s debate moderator performances in the GOP primaries (going all the way back to 2007) shows a decades-long pattern of questions designed to antagonize, embarrass or mock Republican candidates, their policies and supporters. 

 

QUESTIONS FROM 2015 CNBC GOP PRIMARY DEBATE

 





 

CNBC White House correspondent John Harwood questions to Donald Trump:


“Mr. Trump, you’ve done very well in this campaign so far by promising to....make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others....Let’s be honest. Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?”....

“I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties. They said that you have as much chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms?”


CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla to Sen. Marco Rubio:


“This one is for Senator Rubio. You’ve been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s....You’re skipping more votes than any senator to run for president. Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or at least finish what you start?”


CNBC anchor Becky Quick to Dr. Ben Carson:


“Let’s talk about taxes. You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and – I’ve looked at it – and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I’ve had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this. If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you’re gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion. That is less than half of what we bring in right now. And by the way, it’s gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole. So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?”


Becky Quick to Rubio:


“Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that you’ve had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills. You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought....In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy?”


Harwood to Gov. Mike Huckabee:


“The leading Republican candidate – when you look at the average national polls right now – is Donald Trump. When you look at him, do you see someone him with the moral authority to unite the country?”


 

QUESTIONS FROM 2011 NBC NEWS/POLITICO GOP PRIMARY DEBATE

 





 

NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams to Gov. Rick Perry:


“Governor Perry, we’re going to begin with you. You’re the newcomer here on stage, you probably saw this coming a mile away. You have touted your state’s low taxes, the lack of regulation, tough tort reform, as the recipe for job growth in the Lone Star state, but Texas ranks last among those who have completed high school, there are only eight other states with more living in poverty, no other state has more working at or below the minimum wage, so is that the kind of answer all Americans are looking for?”


Williams to Rep. Ron Paul:


“You’re known as the absolutist in the bunch, someone who has consistently opposed federal government from having any role, and I think by your definition, that isn’t explicitly laid out in the Constitution, so this makes people curious. Is there a line with you, where do you draw it? Does this include things like making cars safe, making medicine safe, air traffic control, controlling the jets above our heads?”


Politico’s John Harris to Perry:


“Governor Perry, you clearly don’t like the Massachusetts plan as an example for other states, but Massachusetts has nearly universal health insurance – it’s first in the country. In Texas, about a quarter of the people don’t have health insurance. That's 50 out of 50, dead last. Sir, it’s pretty hard to defend dead last.”


Williams to Sen. Rick Santorum:


“Senator Santorum, on another front, you’re a devout Catholic, you’ve always said that you cannot, will not, place it aside in your role in elected public life. In fact, you thought President Kennedy, the first to be elected President, did so a little bit too much with his own religion. Having said that, the Catholic faith, has as a part of it, caring for the poor. One in seven people in this country, now, qualifies as poor. Where do the poor come in, where do they place in this party, on this stage, in a Santorum administration?”


 Williams to Perry: 


“Governor Perry, a somewhat related question. I’ll quote the Pew Research Center. They recently found white households have 20 times the median wealth of black households in the United States. How would you address that question, that problem, as President?”


Harris to Perry: 


“Governor Perry, you said you wrote the book Fed Up to start a conversation, congratulations, it has certainly done that in recent weeks. In the book, you call Social Security the best example of a program that quote ‘violently tossed aside any respect for state’s rights.’ We understand your position that it’s got funding problems now, I’d like you to explain your view that Social Security was wrong right from the beginning.”


Williams to Paul:


“Let me ask you something else, it’s related in a way, it has to do with Mother Nature. Before the broadcast, Senator Santorum’s got flooding today in Pennsylvania, Governor Perry is back from the wildfires out east, category one storm laid waste to entire areas, there’s standing water tonight in Paterson, New Jersey, many of the towns around where I live, eight days without power. We had people eating in outdoor and public parks because the supermarkets were closed down. Question is, federal aid, something like FEMA, if you object to what it’s become, how it’s run. Your position is to remove it, take it away, abolish it, what happens in its absence?”


Williams to Perry:


“Governor Perry, you can’t have much of a workforce without a basis of education. As you know, your state ranks among the worst in the country in high school graduation rates, as we established. Yet, you recently signed a budget cut for billions in education funding, you pushed for greater cuts than were in the budget that the legislature passed. You’ve said that education is a top priority, but explain cutting it the way you did, please?”


Williams to Gov. Mitt Romney:


“Governor Romney — you often hear this figure, 47 percent of Americans pay no federal income tax, and the promised effort underway soon, at least, in Washington to correct that. Isn’t some of this argument semantics and won't the effort to correct that be a defacto tax increase?”


Williams to Perry:


“Question about Texas. Your state has executed 234 death row inmates, more than any other governor in modern times — [ audience cheers and applause ] — have you struggled to sleep at night with the idea that any one of those might have been innocent? What do you make of that dynamic that just happened here, the mention of the execution of 234 people drew applause?”


Williams to Paul:


“Congressman Paul, a long time ago, a fellow Texan of yours, a young student teacher in Cotulla, Texas, was horrified to see young kids coming into the classroom hungry, some of them with distended bellies because of hunger. He made a vow that if he had anything to do about it the government would provide meals, hot meals at best, in schools. The young student teacher, of course, later went on to be President Lyndon Johnson. Do you think that is any more — providing nutrition in schools for children — a role of the federal government?”


 

QUESTIONS FROM 2007 MSNBC/POLITICO GOP PRIMARY DEBATE

Politico Executive Editor Jim VandeHei to Gov. Mitt Romney: 


“Daniel Dekovnick from Walnut Creek, California wants to know, ‘What do you dislike most about America?’” 


VandeHei to Mayor Rudy Giuliani: 


“Bradley Winter of New York would like to know if there’s anything you learned, or regret, during your time as Mayor in your dealings with the African-American community?”


VandeHei to Gov. Mike Huckabee:


“Thousands of reputable scientists have concluded, with almost certainty, that human activity is responsible for the warming of the Earth. Do you believe global warming exists?” 


VandeHei to Rep. Tom Tancredo: 


“Will you work to protect women’s rights, as in fair wages and reproductive choice?”


MSNBC host Chris Matthews to all the candidates on the debate stage: 


“Would it be good for America to have Bill Clinton back living in the White House?”


 

The pattern of bias is clear and established.

1580,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",PBS 'Washington Week' Insists Biden's 'Independent' of Justice Dept. on Trump Matters,"June 12th, 2023 1:15 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/12/pbs-washington-week-insists-bidens-independent-justice-dept-trump,"The PBS Friday night journalist roundtable show Washington Week sounded like State-Run TV as guest host Laura Barron-Lopez touted the “revealing and damning” Trump indictment by Biden’s Justice Department. It was the only topic for the half-hour. She methodically repeated the White House spin as her own take: 






LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, GUEST HOST: And the Justice Department has been extremely careful to show how independent they are. This is a special counsel investigation, which even adds other level of independence from the Justice Department. The Justice Department is saying, we`re not talking to the White House about this. What has President Biden said so far?


Keep in mind that one way Biden can prevent public comment on the Justice Department is by avoiding the press, and the press can avoid the entire question of the Department’s independence by treating the idea as blatantly obvious, beyond question as LBL does here. Ed O’Keefe of CBS answered her bland inquiry with more Biden PR: 


 O’KEEFE: Oh, as little as he can. He was asked about it just hours before the former president announced the indictment, saying, 'What would you say to those who are concerned that the Justice Department is being used for political means?' And he pointed out that throughout his presidency, he has never once, publicly or otherwise, criticized or weighed in on a potential charge of somebody involved in Justice Department matters, and arguing sort of indirectly that that's exactly what Donald Trump used to do. 

He had politicized the department. He had fired various personnel for making decisions that he didn't disagree with -- or that he didn't agree with, and Biden has done the opposite. We know that in this case, they learned about it through media reports, that the president was not given a heads-up. Nobody at the White House was. Nobody ever is. Whenever there's some new Trump legal matter, we always go back and ask, 'Did you guys get a heads-up?' They always say, 'No, we learned about it from you guys.' And they have gone to great lengths over the course of this administration to keep senior Justice Department officials literally and figuratively out of the White House and to keep the communication between them above board as much as possible and focused on loftier political goals that have nothing to do with the legal work that they continue to do.”


President Obama also had a habit of claiming ""we learned it from you guys"" on scandal matters. Everyone should factor in a very different media under Trump, constantly suggesting every Trump attorney general was extremely partisan and in Trump's back pocket. They protect and repeat Biden. They savaged Trump. So media behavior affects White House behavior.

O’Keefe then blandly mentioned Biden’s “own son” (without using the name Hunter Biden) is under investigation, making it “more awkward” if Biden ever talked to Garland about such things, “which he simply has not done.” Notice how blindly these supposedly cynical reporters accept everything Team Biden says at face value.

PS: Journalists have tenderly noted in public Biden's frustration with Garland. On April 2, 2022, The New York Times reported Garland was too independent, or too “deliberative,” enough “to frustrate Democratic allies of the White House and, at times, President Biden himself.” They signaled Biden confided to his inner circle that Trump “was a threat to democracy and should be prosecuted, according to two people familiar with his comments. And while the president has never communicated his frustrations directly to Mr. Garland, he has said privately that he wanted Mr. Garland to act less like a ponderous judge and more like a prosecutor who is willing to take decisive action over the events of Jan. 6.”

1581,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Scarborough's Latest MAGA Conspiracy Theory Shot Down by His Leftist Experts,"June 12th, 2023 10:46 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mark-finkelstein/2023/06/12/scarboroughs-latest-maga-conspiracy-theory-shot-down-his,"Joe Scarborough was angry on Monday's Morning Joe, that a Trump-appointed judge might prevent his ""walls are closing in"" scenario for Trump, with a happy Lock Him Up ending for the MSNBC crowd. 


 ""Obviously a bizarre, a bizarre appointment for this judge, Cannon. I mean the fact there are, I think, 15 different [judges who were in the selection pool. You and I both know that you get the luck of the draw on this. And the odds of this woman getting this, with 15? Come on, man.""


That's the selection of Aileen Cannon as the judge in the trial of Donald Trump on federal criminal charges relating to his handling of classified documents.  Back in September, she ordered the appointment of a special master to review the documents seized by the FBI in its search of Mar-a-Lago. Her ruling was overturned by the 11th Circuit.

So, Joe, if not the luck of the draw, what was it? The dastardly deed of the deep state? A hoax? Maybe a witch hunt against Jack Smith? 

Interestingly, both of Scarborough's expert guests—neither being in any way a Trump fan—shot down Joe's fevered fantasy. 





Former US Attorney Chuck Rosenberg said:


""I don't know that it's anything but luck of the draw, Joe. I don't know that. If it's something else, if it's, if it's something nefarious, that'll come out. It always does.""


Rosenberg added ""there's a big difference between a bad judge and an unprincipled judge. And I can't tell you right now that I believe she's unprincipled. She may just be a bad judge. She may be just not very good at her job."" Like morning cable hosts who throw out conspiracy theories that get shot down.

 Palm Beach County Attorney Dave Aronberg [an elected Democrat] was even more emphatic in rejecting Scarborough's Florida fantasy. He began by pointing out that Scarborough simply had his facts wrong. Cannon was not picked out of a pool of 15 judges, as Scarborough claimed. There were only four judges in the pool of possible selections. Concluded Aronberg flatly:


""There's no conspiracy here. I know the clerk of court down there, Ms. Noble, and she's awesome, she's honest. And this is a random assignment. It's just bad luck.There's no conspiracy here . . . It's just bad luck.""


The fact that Aronberg saw the selection of Cannon as ""bad luck"" further demonstrates his anti-Trump leanings, thus bolstering the objectivity of his opinion.

So, sorry, Joe!—but nice try as always for Team Liberal Media!

On Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough denying that it was simply the luck of the draw that a Trump appointee was selected as the judge in his trial on federal charges regarding his handling of classified documents was sponsored in part by ADT, Constant Contact, Purple Mattresses, and Volvo.

Here's the transcript.


MSNBC
Morning Joe

6:20 am EDT

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let, let, let me ask you, though. Obviously a bizarre, a bizarre appointment for this judge, Cannon. I mean the fact there are, I think, 15 different [judges who were in the selection pool.""

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: She's definitely the judge?

SCARBOROUGH: Fifteen. That's the first thing I want to ask. 

. . . 

They [the 11th Circuit, in overturning a previous ruling by Judge Cannon regarding the appointment of a special master] basically say this woman just violated bedrock principles in the Constitution to try to protect Donald Trump. It was one of the most scathing, scathing, rulings I've ever seen, overturning a lower court's ruling. And this person's in charge of the case? Does she stay in charge throughout the entire case?

CHUCK ROSENBERG: Probably so, Joe. So the 11th Circuit, I read their opinion, too, was not gentle until their review of her actions. I read what she did, and what they said about what she did. And they had it right!

Now, look, there's a big difference between a bad judge and an unprincipled judge. And I can't tell you right now that I believe she's unprincipled. She may just be a bad judge. She may be just not very good at her job. 

Look, there are dentists and airline pilots who are really good, and there are dentists and airline pilots who are awful.

MIKA: That doesn't make anyone feel better.

SCARBOROUGH: You and I both know that you get the luck of the draw on this. And the odds of this woman getting this, with 15, come on, man.

How did, how did this woman of all women, of all judges who, again, probably put down the worst, the worst ruling, had the, again, the 11th Circuit, one of the most conservative Circuits. How could that judge be assigned this? It seems far from luck of the draw.

ROSENBERG: Well, look, I don't know that it's anything but luck of the draw, Joe. I don't know that. If it's something else, if it's, if it's something nefarious, that'll come out. It always does.

. . . 

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Dave Aronberg, as you well know, the chief clerk of the federal court system in the southern district of Florida confirmed that judge Cannon would -- this is her trial unless she were to recuse herself. So it seems like that's a done deal. Give us your thoughts on that, and also just preview, please, what we're going to see tomorrow in this historic moment, when a former President of the United States appears in a courthouse to face federal charges.

DAVE ARONBERG: Yeah, Jonathan, I want to show you. This is the sheet where Jack Smith checked the box for the court division, and here he checked West Palm Beach, and that's why judge Cannon had a really good chance at getting this.

It wasn't 1-out-of-15, Joe. It was 1-out-of-4. Four judges who are in that West Palm Beach division. And it depends on workload.

So, there's no conspiracy here. I know the clerk of court down there, Ms. Noble, and she's awesome, she's honest. And this is a random assignment.

1582,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Soft vs. Hard Bigotry With the Ladies of ‘The View’,"June 12th, 2023 9:41 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/cal-thomas/2023/06/12/soft-vs-hard-bigotry-ladies-view,"When George W. Bush was running for president in 2000, he spoke to the NAACP’s 91st annual convention where he coined the phrase “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”

By that he meant the attitude held by some that if one is Black, it automatically means they should not be expected to achieve much in life because so many start off in circumstances that are difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.

Senator and Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott channeled Bush’s statement when he was a recent guest on “The View,” a highly partisan TV program that seems to hate all things Republican. Scott decided to go on the ABC show after host Joy Behar claimed Scott “doesn’t get racism.”

Scott indeed “gets” racism. As his friend, former Congressman Trey Gowdy has said, Scott has been stopped numerous times while driving simply because he is Black. Gowdy has also said guards at the U.S. Senate have delayed Scott from entering the building and asked for identification even while he was wearing his Senate pin.

In his appearance on “The View” (Behar was conveniently “off” that day so he couldn’t confront his primary accuser), Scott said in response to claims by Behar and others that he and other successful Black Republicans are “exceptions not the rule” that it’s “a dangerous, offensive, disgusting message to send to our young people today.”

Indeed it is, and it’s also a far more subtle and less observable form of racism. If a Black child is told, overtly or covertly, he or she cannot succeed in life, many will internalize that message. Some will use it as an excuse to engage in crime, including the looting of stores and even shootings as we constantly witness in some of our major cities. Others will simply give up, or drop out of school, dooming far too many to a life of failure and antisocial behavior.

Scott tried to present evidence that despite racism, which he acknowledges exists, there are growing numbers of Black people who are succeeding and ought to be seen not as exceptions, but examples for others to follow:

“The fact of the matter is we’ve had an African American president, African American vice president, we’ve had two African Americans to be secretaries of state. In my home city, the police chief is an African American who’s now running for mayor.”

Facts don’t matter to the left because a change in attitude would require a change in policies that are clearly not working to the benefit of too many Black people. Freeing Black children from poorly performing schools would be a meaningful first step, something Scott has long advocated and the left opposes, even while many, including elected officials, sent their kids to private schools.

This latest dust-up between the left and Scott reminds me of a visit I made with Rev. Jesse Jackson to an all-Black middle school in the mid 1980s. Jackson told the young people not to have babies until they are married, stay off drugs and study hard. Any conservative could have given that speech. I recall urging him to speak less of politics and more about what he told those students. Alas, he did not follow my advice, but his challenge to those students was one more of them needed to hear.

“We Shall Overcome” was a powerful song when Black Americans were trying to overcome the racism of their day. A new one might be called “We Have Overcome,” sung to inspire people who did what Jackson advised and who should urge others to follow the example of the successful.",279108,,['Cal Thomas'],"['an African American', 'Republicans', 'African Americans', 'African American', 'Black', 'Black Americans', 'Republican']","['Tim Scott', 'Scott', 'Behar', 'Gowdy', 'Jackson', 'Bush', 'George W.

The oh-so-progressive cheered wildly like they were all in Stephen Colbert's late-night audience. 

First and foremost, actress Denee Benton -- currently in the HBO series The Gilded Age -- appeared to promote an Outstanding Theatre Education award sponsored by Carnegie-Mellon University (she's an alumna). The award went to a drama teacher in Plantation, Florida, so Benton couldn't resist joking that Gov. Ron DeSantis was a ""Grand Wizard"" of the Ku Klux Klan -- like she's too young to know the KKK were Democrats. The joke was he would rename ""Plantation"" -- because he wants to eliminate black history, get it?

1584,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Slate.com Panic Attack Over Trump-Appointed Judge Selected in Trump Documents Case,"June 11th, 2023 9:44 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/pj-gladnick/2023/06/11/slatecom-panic-attack-over-trump-appointed-judge-selected-trump,"On Friday, MSNBC acted ""concerned"" over the news that Aileen Cannon was chosen as the judge to oversee the Trump documents case. However, the MSNBC reaction was mild compared to the sheer panic over Cannon in an article published by Slate magazine that same day. Mark Joseph Stern, Slate's senior writer on legal matters sounds like he will spend many sleepless nights over his extreme fear that ""Judge Aileen Cannon Can Absolutely Sink the Federal Prosecution of Trump.""


The federal criminal case against Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents will be overseen, at least initially, by Judge Aileen Cannon, according to the New York Times. This is excellent news for Trump and exceedingly bad news for special counsel Jack Smith. Cannon’s total lack of principle, combined with her evident incapacity to experience shame, renders her a uniquely favorable jurist for the former president. Indeed, if she maintains her grasp on this case, it is nearly impossible to envision Smith securing a conviction in her courtroom.


EEEK! And what gives Stern nightmares is that this case hasn't been assigned to a liberal judge who can be counted on to pressure the jury into the desirable outcome of convicting Trump.


Cannon, a Trump appointee, gained notoriety while presiding over Trump’s attempt to halt the classified documents investigation in 2022. Following the search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s lawyers filed a complaint alleging that the search was illegitimate and unconstitutional; they demanded the appointment of a special master and, in the meantime, a freeze on prosecutors’ review of seized materials. In a calculated act of judge shopping, the case was assigned to Cannon, who leaped at the opportunity to prove her fidelity to the man who’d appointed her and, perhaps, audition for a future Supreme Court seat. Trump’s lawsuit amounted to pure gibberish, a glorified Truth Social post that alleged a Democratic conspiracy. So Cannon promptly encouraged his lawyers to rewrite the suit so it sounded marginally less asinine. She then issued an order prohibiting the government from “further review and use of any of the materials” seized from Mar-a-Lago “for criminal investigative purposes.”


GASP! She gave a decision favorable for Trump. Not permitted in a world where the federal government has largely been politically weaponized. You can't fight weaponizers! Stern notes Smith has the option of requesting a different judge, although ""Trump would surely fight such a request, and it’s impossible to say where the 11th Circuit would come down.""

It's not impossible to say where Mark Joseph Stern and his fellow media liberals would come down. And is there a Xanax bottle big enough to calm him down if Judge Cannon remains on the case?

After all, Stern insists ""her name is already synonymous with MAGA-style judicial corruption. The simplest way to put it is that if Cannon remains assigned to this case, Trump will not be convicted, no matter how damning the evidence. That conclusion is not defeatist or cynical; it is a mere acknowledgment of the reality that Republicans have created by stacking the bench with venal mediocrities like Aileen Cannon.""",279118,,['P.J.

“Some people say, well the Republicans have rallied around Donald Trump, he's under threat,” Dickerson observed. “But what if the way this is being framed by Republicans, which is this is all partisan, this is all a manipulation of the system, creates an appetite for Donald Trump,” he worried. 

 





 

“In other words if it's all rigged we want the best rigger in the game on our side,” he added. 

CBS White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe put Dickerson’s nerves at ease by noting “if that's the case, then I think the polling continues to show us they can nominate him but he may be set up to lose again.”

O’Keefe went on the explain that “In the general election we're seeing Americans overall believe that this was justified, that he should be prosecuted, right, and then, of course, he lost last time, and there's nothing yet that suggests that he would win a general election other than perhaps some horse race numbers this early.” 

It wouldn’t be a CBS segment if there wasn’t some pro-Biden PR so O’Keefe filled that quota in the next breath.

Summarizing a recently released poll, O’Keefe editorialized that there’s “one thing I think gives Democrats something to be hopeful about those general election matchups, you asked about attributes in a President, who you want or what characteristics you want in a President.”

“Topping the list was truthfulness, right? Character and empathy. At the bottom of that list, was someone who’s articulate, energetic and youthful, right?” 

“So if you're the Biden campaign right now you go oh, they want the truthful truth telling—that's us, right? We're not the articulate youthful one. So that whole argument has gone away. That’s why they remain hopeful that if it is Trump they can still win this thing,” O’Keefe added hopefully.

1586,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Unabomber Dies in Prison: Remember When Some Journalists PRAISED Him?,"June 11th, 2023 3:32 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/11/unabomber-dies-prison-remember-when-some-journalists-praised-him,"The apparent death by suicide of ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski might come as a ""who's that"" from younger citizens. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated bombs that killed three people and maimed or injured 23 others.

Nevertheless, our Best of Notable Quotables 1996 edition included several sickening examples of journalists praising the eco-terrorist


""He [Ted Kaczynski] wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote. His manifesto, and there are a lot of things in it that I would agree with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization and pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any plumbing, he didn't have any electricity.""

-- Time Washington reporter Elaine Shannon talking about the Unabomber, April 7, 1996 C-SPAN Sunday Journal. 

 ""I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting. The original Unabomber -- the anonymous, hooded fellow, hiding behind aviator glasses -- was uninteresting, a freak, a nobody. But Theodore Kaczynski is someone very interesting indeed...I envy his disobedience....the [manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force....

If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."" 

-- Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10, 1996.


There was also this: 


""It could be argued that the Unabomber at least had the courage of his convictions. He -- again, assuming the feds have the right man -- lived in 'wild nature.' He battled the machine.""-- Los Angeles Times columnist Peter H. King, April 10, 1996.


In a different category, just days later, Bryant Gumbel was blaming the Oklahoma City bombing on conservative talk radio (again).


NBC's Bryant Gumbel: ""You mention talk radio. They [relatives of Oklahoma bombing victims] have some very hard feelings about talk radio and the hate being spewed by some of those on the far end of the spectrum.""

Bill Moyers, PBS omnipresence: ""If anything, talk radio in that part of the world is more anti-government today than ever. The airwaves are saturated with hostility, it's just an unremitting vilification of government. Sometimes it's, sometimes it's, you know, the government makes mistakes and there are justifiable grievances against government. But this is, this goes beyond that, it's excessive. And these people take it like salt in the wound. They drive around, they turn on their radio, they hear some vicious attack on government, and they think, `You know, if you strike the government, you kill my daughter.'""

-- Bill Moyers on the April 12, 1996Today promoting that night's Dateline on the families of and victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. 


Leftist journalists tried to claim you couldn't pin the Unabomber on the Left: 


""One source told the San Francisco Examiner that Kaczynski was 'disgusted with the widespread drug use and liberal politics' at Berkeley. Maybe so: the Unabomer [sic] manifesto is harshly critical of leftism.""-- Newsweek Senior Writer Tom Morganthau, April 15 issue.

""Yet no one, either at Michigan or Berkeley, remembers Ted having any contact with the leftists he would later excoriate in his manifesto.""-- Time Senior Editor Nancy Gibbs, April 15. The Unabomber manifesto begins: ""The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.""


In the June 7, 1996 CyberAlert, MRC's Brent Baker reported:


In the ""On the Prowl"" section, the June American Spectator reported: ""FBI agents on the scene are telling colleagues they were amused when, while tearing apart the shack of suspected Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, they came upon Al Gore's 1992 eco-tract, Earth in the Balance. Many sections were underlined in pencil, and there were copious notes in the margins. Why wasn't Gore among the handful of titles listed in press references to the 80 or so books found in the cabin? The FBI and Justice Department haven't commented publicly, but some agents assume the title was clearly suppressed to avoid embarrassing Gore.""

This week Rush Limbaugh discussed the charge on his show, prompting former NBC News reporter Carl Stern, now Janet Reno's chief flack, to issue a denial. From the June 6 Los Angeles Times: ""The Justice Department insists that Gore's book is not among about 200 found by investigators. 'We're at the mercy of any mischief making,' grumbled Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern. 'There is no way to prove what isn't there.'""

It's nice to see Stern squirm from a media report. If only the major media would show a little interest in pursuing the story.


No one asked Al Gore to denounce the guy who was inspired by him.

PS: In 2015, remarkably unfunny Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore compared Kaczynski to Ted Cruz: “Ted Cruz went to Harvard, just like Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

Bash walked right into a buzz saw when she, as usual, acted like a Democrat hack instead of a journalist. 

After arguing with Ramaswamy on the details of Trump's indictment and whether or not he was in the wrong, Bash was told: ""if Trump's judgment was bad, President Biden's judgment is worse for actually bringing a prosecution. He should have done what Trump did."" 

Bash then jumped in to ""fact check"" him despite rarely, if ever doing the same to her Democrat guests. ""President Biden didn't bring a prosecution,"" Bash proclaimed. 

 





 

""The Department of Justice reports to the President of the United States...Which is why I think the media needs to get to the bottom of this,"" he responded before getting interrupted again.

""If the same shoe fit the other foot you would not take their word at face value. Do not take their word now. Get to the bottom of it. Let's actually restore journalism in this country. That’s what’s actually missing is getting to the truth,"" he added.

Looking and sounding annoyed, Bash snarked ""okay, thank you for that. We are absolutely asking these questions.""

Without any sense of irony, Bash then proclaimed ""we know how to be good journalists because we do it every single day."" 

In fact, what Bash said couldn't have been any further from the truth.

RAMASWAMY: The Department of Justice reports to the President of the United States and so this is a—

BASH: Okay. 

RAMASWAMY: Which is why I think the media needs to get to the bottom of this. 

BASH: But there’s no evidence. There’s absolutely no evidence, unless you can show me some, that President Biden has had anything to do with this prosecution. That is why he put two layers in between. 

RAMASWAMY: With due respect I think it is shameful that I as a competitor to President Trump in this race have to ask questions that the media isn't asking. The job of the political media if it has one job is to hold the U.S. government accountable. 

BASH: Yes. We know that.

After a highly-partisan opening monologue and subsequent panel discussion of Trump's legal woes, the former Clinton administration official turned to Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. It did not go well for him. 

""Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he did nothing wrong,"" Stephanopoulos noted. Do you believe that?"" 

 





 

The Senator didn't take the bait and instead turned it around on the Democrat activist. ""Well, here’s what I believe. We live in an America where if you’re the Democratic candidate for President, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, you can set up a private server in your basement to conduct government business,"" Graham said before getting rudely cut off. 

""Senator,"" Stephanopoulos said in frustration. 

Graham angrily shot back: ""No, let me finish!"" 

""But you didn't answer the question,"" the host replied. 

Shoving his leftist bias back in his face, Graham rebutted ""I am trying to answer the question from a Republican point of view. That may not be acceptable on this show."" 

Finally getting a chance to utter a complete thought without getting rudely interrupted, Graham schooled him:


What I don't like is a system in America where the Secretary of State, who's a Democratic candidate for president, has people take a hammer to social media devices and break them apart, apply bleach bit to a hard drive to erase emails, allowed classified information to get on a felon’s computer, Anthony Weiner. You haven’t even mentioned that! Most Republicans believe we live in a country where Hillary Clinton did very similar things and nothing happened to her. President Trump will have his day in court. But Espionage charges are absolutely ridiculous. Whether you like Trump or not, he did not commit Espionage. He did not disseminate, leak, or provide information to a foreign power or a news organization that damaged this country. He's not a spy. He’s overcharged. Did he do things wrong? Yes, he may have. He will be tried about that. But Hillary Clinton wasn’t.


Graham then brought up a sore subject that is rarely mentioned on ABC's This Week, that one of the moderators is a former Clinton administration staffer: ""Your old boss committed perjury in a civil lawsuit. Lost his law license, obstructed justice in a dozen ways and he didn't get prosecuted.""

""And he was impeached,"" Stephanopoulos responded trying to deflate Graham's argument. 

""Well, he was impeached but he wasn’t prosecuted,"" Graham shot back. 

Stephanopoulos then stuttered and attempted to change the subject: ""You’ve made your point.""

As previously reported by NewsBusters, on Friday Stephanopoulos acted in a similar manner when then-Trump attorney Jim Trusty brought up the Biden classified documents scandal as an example of there being unequal justice in the United States.

It's clear the former Clinton staffer has very thin skin.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he did nothing wrong. Do you believe that?

LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, here’s what I believe. We live in an America where if you’re the Democratic candidate for President, Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State, you can set up a private server in your basement to conduct government business. 

STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator–

GRAHAM: And when an investigation is had about your activity—No, let me finish!

STEPHANOPOULOS: But you didn't answer the question.

GRAHAM: Well, I am trying to answer the question from a Republican point of view. That may not be acceptable on this show. Yes, I don't like what President Trump did in certain aspects. I don't like that Joe Biden had classified information on the garage. I don't like that Mike Pence carelessly took classified information. I don't like any of that. But what I don't like is a system in America where the Secretary of State, who's a Democratic candidate for president, has people take a hammer to social media devices and break them apart, apply bleach bit to a hard drive to erase emails, allowed classified information to get on a felon’s computer, Anthony Weiner.

1589,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Liberal Podcaster Kara Swisher: CNN Overlord 'Needs to Get the F—k Out of the Way’,"June 11th, 2023 6:57 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/11/liberal-podcaster-kara-swisher-cnn-overlord-needs-get-f-k-out-way,"Fox News media reporter Brian Flood reported that former New York Times columnist and podcaster Kara Swisher proclaimed Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav ""needs to get the f—k out of the way"" and ""let the professionals take over"" and try to fix CNN.

Zaslav's pick as CNN CEO, Chris Licht, was pushed out this week after the CNN employees were in revolt after CNN's town hall with Donald Trump. After that show, CNN's ratings dipped even lower, losing to Newsmax on some nights.

""I think they can be news without having to declare constantly they're centrist,"" Swisher said on her ""Pivot"" podcast for New York magazine. ""That was… very much David Zaslav. Let me just say, I think Chris was a proxy for him.""

""It's a bad business, and he got a bad morale,"" Swisher said of Licht. She proclaimed there was ""no upside"" to Licht's year-long with Tim Alberta of The Atlantic. She kept saying of Licht, ""Can you stop talking? You need to stop talking."" She said Licht didn't ""read the room"" that CNN employees loved the old boss, Jeff Zucker. ""I think media reporters decided to feast on this guy, and by the way, he kind of deserves it.""

Swisher said she’s previously had ""vexing"" conversations with Zaslav about his theories on journalism. 

""I think he’s a very smart programmer, but honestly, it’s like talking to my uncle about journalism,"" Swisher said. ""I’m like, ‘What?’ I said ‘what’ a lot during our conversation, so he needs to let the professionals take over and see if they can make good programming. He needs to get the f—k out of the way."" 

Swisher added that she feels Zaslav ""worships at the altar"" of Warner Bros. Discovery board member John Malone, who has said CNN needs to ""actually have journalists"" and urged the network to revert to doing ""news"" instead of opinion. Swisher obviously reflects the viewpoint of the Zucker fans inside CNN and bragged ""I get more calls from CNN people [who are] unhappy.""

In 2021, Malone said ""I would like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with, and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing."" Then he really roiled CNN with ""Fox News, in my opinion, has followed an interesting trajectory of trying to have ‘news’ news, I mean some actual journalism, embedded in a program schedule of all opinions."" 

Swisher recently tweeted Rupert Murdoch and his ""minions"" are a ""coven of toxic ghouls.""

To get a sense of what Swisher thinks ""the news"" is, she proclaimed that she gets most of her television via streaming shows, but she likes Stephanie Ruhle's MSNBC show late at night because ""I like the news at the end of the days, and I think she does a very fair job of it.""",279113,,['Tim Graham'],['New York'],"['David Zaslav', 'Jeff Zucker', 'Chris', 'Brian Flood', 'Tim Alberta', 'Rupert Murdoch', ""Stephanie Ruhle's"", 'Zucker', 'Swisher', 'Zaslav', 'Donald Trump', 'Malone', 'Kara Swisher', 'John Malone', 'Chris Licht', 'Licht']","['Newsmax', 'Warner Bros.

1590,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",CNN Self-Sabotages with Intolerance for Opposing Points of View,"June 10th, 2023 4:00 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/jeffrey-lord/2023/06/10/cnn-self-sabotages-intolerance-opposing-points-view,"Americans are now all too well aware that no matter where they are to be found in American society, woke leftists are always considered to be more important to woke leftism’s cult-like followers then what they are actually tasked to do in their individual jobs.

This scenario is in the spotlight these days in America’s public schools. There is one news report after another out there telling the tale of parent groups angrily confronting school boards for indoctrinating, as opposed to educating, their kids.

Whether one examines religion - notably mainline Protestant denominations - or sports (see: the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Catholic mocking Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence) or corporate America (see: Bud Light or Target) or more, it is self-evident that woke leftism is much more important to these woke leftists than what, in fact, their actual job requires them to do. Whether that job is preaching mainline Protestant doctrine, playing baseball or selling beer or clothes and other goods.

This disease of woke leftism is now in the process of devouring CNN -- once considered the gold standard of just-the-facts journalism when founded by billionaire Atlanta advertising guy Ted Turner.

Recall that Turner wrote this in his autobiography when recalling why he created CNN:


Although I hadn’t watched much television news, I did have some strong opinions about what I wanted CNN to be. While the networks and local news stations seemed to follow a ‘if it bleeds, it leads,’ rule centering their broadcasts on murders, car wrecks, disasters, and the like, I wanted us to do more serious journalism and go deeper into the more important issues of the day. I also wanted to present the news in an unbiased fashion. At that time, some of the evening anchors, including Walter Cronkite, were injecting their own opinions into the telecasts and I just didn’t like it. (CNN President Reese) Schonfeld and I decided that on CNN, news would be the star, not our on-air people.


Suffice to say, as the dismissal of CNN CEO Chris Licht this week illustrates vividly, CNN staff and employees are long gone from Ted Turner’s founding vision. The star at CNN now is supposed to be woke leftism, not journalism. In today’s world the entire point of CNN’s woke lefties existence is to present the news in a decidedly far-left fashion. And if you disagree with that - as Chris Licht did - they are coming for you.

It matters not to these people if the CNN ratings fall below the basement. Like the executives at Anheuser-Busch, Target and with the L.A. Dodgers, the CNNers are all about not the job at hand, in their case Ted Turner’s vision of just-the-facts-journalism. No, they are about virtue signaling with their woke leftism -- ratings be damned.

And CNN is most assuredly not alone in this approach to journalism. What began to push Licht out the door was a lengthy piece in The Atlantic by lefty journo Tim Alberta. The article is a classic in left-wing journalism, illustrating vividly that lefty journalists are all about gathering in their airless clubhouse where no opposition is tolerated.

Full disclosure, I found myself mentioned by Alberta in discussing CNN’s 2016 role, mentioning my time as a CNN contributor. The telling graph read this way: 


However self-serving his criticisms of (CNN CEO predecessor Jeff) Zucker, Licht had legitimate reasons to be wary of his predecessor’s approach. CNN had produced some terrific reporting during the Trump years, but it had also embarrassed itself, and the industry as a whole, on more than a few occasions. The use of paid contributors such as Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski, the latter of whom appeared on air while still being paid by the Trump campaign, served no defensible journalistic purpose.


I confess it was impossible to read this without laughing out loud at the amazing lack of self-awareness displayed here by Alberta. My presence on CNN during the 2016 race and that of former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as we made opposing arguments to our liberal colleagues “served no defensible journalistic purpose”? Really?  Which is to say, disagreeing with the left and their fanatic support of all things left is simply not “defensible journalism.” To air conservatives or, in that case, Trump supporters, was a big no-no in the lefty woke world. It's ""bothsidesism.""

To say that is the real reveal in Alberta’s article and the dismissal of Chris Licht would to be understate the problem.

The entire Atlantic piece, not to mention the magazine itself, is all about virtue signaling woke leftism. That’s fine as far as it goes. Free speech is a good thing. God Bless America.

But the problem vividly illustrated both in the Atlantic article and the firing of Chris Licht mere days later as a result is that the American left is intolerant of dissent. It is populated by would-be media totalitarians who will brook no dissent in the world of what they see as an exclusive left-wing platform. It is no small thing that when Licht had CNN host a town hall with Donald Trump, CNN’s ratings soared. And CNN’s employees rebelled. 

As my NewsBusters colleague Curtis Houck has correctly said of what’s to come in Licht’s absence:


In the interim, expect CNN employees to feel liberated to return to flashing more of their visceral hatred for Trump and conservatives.


And if you don’t like it? Don’t watch.

Clearly, millions of Americans have gotten the message. CNN is now about self-sabotage -- and those millions of Americans are now choosing not to watch.",279097,,['Jeffrey Lord'],"['Alberta', 'American', 'Americans', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'Atlanta', 'America']","['Walter Cronkite', 'Alberta', 'Curtis Houck', 'Corey Lewandowski', 'Jeff) Zucker', 'Jeffrey Lord', 'Ted Turner’s', 'Trump', 'Ted Turner', 'Tim Alberta', 'Turner', 'Donald Trump', 'Reese) Schonfeld', 'Chris Licht', 'Licht']","['the Los Angeles Dodgers', 'Target', 'the L.A.

Not only does the stand-up comedienne lean aggressively to the Left, she also apologizes for past jokes that may have hurt someone’s feelings.

That’s a twofer for a news network yet to apologize for promoting the Russian collusion hoax for multiple years.

Now, MSNBC.com is using the arrival of Silverman’s new Max comedy special, “Someone You Love,” to lecture us about Humor, Inc.

 





 

Silverman once shot from the comedic hip, slaying audiences with her raw humor. Now, she toes the woke line, avoiding all the off-limit targets but excoriating the Right early and often. She brags she’s free from Cancel Culture’s grip, but when a comic follows all the approved narratives you know the mob won’t come their way.

The MSNBC op-ed shifts from Silverman to the “new” comedy rules, because there’s nothing that inspires great humor like creative guidelines.

The author, MSNBC columnist Jacques Berlinerblau, is such a whiz at analyzing comedy that he isn’t sure Cancel Culture exists in the space.

Here’s a pro tip: It does, and the examples are endless.

Later, Berlinerblau argues comedians must always punch up, not down (a comedy saw that gets shoved aside if the people in the latter category are conservatives or Christians).

The worst part is yet to come.

Berlinerblau advises comedians to self-censor, which is another way to promote censorship.

Free speech purists and libertarians might respond to this five-step program by fulminating: Voluntary self-censorship! Slippery slope! Isn’t art about liberty, man?

Maybe, man. But perhaps comedians ought temporarily ease off the un-nuanced — and even Silverman’s more nuanced — punch down shtick. Just for now. Just until America divests itself of irrational hatreds and inequality in like a half century. Or half a millennia. Or whenever the Messiah comes.

Dern those free speech purists! What do they know about humor, right? George Carlin clearly knew less than Berlinerblau, by all accounts.

So did Lenny Bruce.

Thankfully, MSNBC has saved both comedy and sanity by giving us the proper guide rules for humor moving forward.

Chris Sununu took his media education tour to CNN and Anderson Cooper 360 on Friday to inform Cooper that it is “just a fact” to say that President Biden is prosecuting President Trump and that the Justice Department needs to win back trust by doing a much better at explaining itself when it decides to prosecute Trump for mishandling classified documents, but not Biden or Hillary Clinton.

Sununu had just finished explaining that somebody from DOJ needs to go on TV to explain themselves and admit that they have made mistakes in the past, when a confused Cooper wondered why, “I guess I just don't understand, what does that mean that the Department of Justice has to own that. I mean, you can have -- two things can be true. They can have made mistakes in the past and in this case play everything by the book, no?”

 





 

Conceding this was true, Sununu still insisted that, “You have to earn back a lot of the trust, right?”

He argued that if the Trump case is truly different that may be acceptable in a court room, but without an accompanying public relations push “it's going to just, again, allow this doubt to permeate.”

Cooper still wasn’t convinced and insisted that the responsible thing to do is to uncritically accept the premise that there’s nothing political about the Trump case, “Right, but isn’t it—alright, but isn’t it responsible—a responsible leader, whether it's on the left or right, would not put out a statement saying that Joe Biden is prosecuting his political opponent?”

Particularly uneasy with House Republicans’ reaction, Cooper continued, “I mean, do you believe that Joe Biden is prosecuting? Which is what we've heard from many Republicans in the House, including Speaker McCarthy. Do you believe that Joe Biden is prosecuting Donald Trump to hurt him in the race?”

Sununu used the opportunity to reiterate his earlier point and to educate Cooper on how the Executive Branch functions:


Joe Biden's Department of Justice is prosecuting the former president, who's running against him. Look, that's just a fact, right? Now, whether you like the tone of that statement and why it's being said and how it's being drummed up by the other side doesn't matter. Those are the facts. So, it's very easy. I guess that's my point. It's so easy to make a statement like that, where the average American goes, yeah, looks like that's happening.


Of course, Sununu is correct. Optics matter and just demanding people trust the DOJ after Clinton’s e-mail server and Russia-gate is not going to work.

ANDERSON COOPER: I guess I just don't understand, what does that mean that the Department of Justice has to own that. I mean, you can have -- two things can be true. They can have made mistakes in the past and in this case play everything by the book, no? 

CHRIS SUNUNU: Yeah, that's absolutely true. And that's what we hope happens, right? It's okay -- look, they made mistakes. That happened. Let's make sure that we're going forward. You have to earn back a lot of the trust, right? 

And so, whether it's talking about some of the other cases, some of the issues, how this one differs -- if they do it just in the courtroom, that's fine legally. But, it's going to just, again, allow this doubt to permeate. And I think all the other candidates need to be talking about that. 

I think everyone needs to be acknowledging it's okay to acknowledge that it's okay to acknowledge mistakes in the past. You can't just ignore them, but by acknowledging them you're putting transparency and that builds up public trust. 

Transparency is what really builds that trust and all the candidates running for president have to acknowledge it. 

COOPER: Right, but isn’t it—alright, but isn’t it responsible—a responsible leader, whether it's on the left or right, would not put out a statement saying that Joe Biden is prosecuting his political opponent?

Host Geoff Bennett led Brooks with an unrelated question about the trial being held in Florida which would mean the jury pool will be far less liberal than in New York City, “it's harder for him to make a convincing argument that he's being railroaded when it's happening in — on his home turf, as I said?”

 





 

Brooks pleaded ignorant, citing is lack of law school experience and turned the conversation back to the political reaction, “If you're running against Donald Trump for president, your job is to take this day and say, ‘see, that guy's not qualified to be president.’ That's like, simple.”

Unfortunately for Brooks that has not happened, “Does Ron DeSantis do that? No. Does Tim Scott do that? No. They're all — they're all jumping on the, it's prosecutive — it's weaponizing the justice system. They're jumping on that, Mike Lee in the Senate. Glenn Youngkin, the supposedly mature and moderate governor of Virginia, he was like ‘selective prosecution.’

Earlier in the show, Bennett had on law professor and former Bush official Jamil Jaffer who argued that it could be possible to compare Trump’s case to Hillary Clinton’s e-mail server. Nevertheless, Brooks continued lamenting about how “he's using this as a political gift, which, for the time being, it seems to be, at least in the Republican Party.”

Marcus then replied that Trump’s reaction was predictable, “But the really sickening thing is what you say about the rest of the party rallying around him. If— I know — we all know why they're doing it. We all know they're doing it not because they believe it, but because they understand it to be in their political self-interest.”

As for the claim itself, Marcus fantasized that:


If I had a superpower right now, I would wield it to ban the word ‘weaponization,’ because what's going on here is the opposite of the weaponization of the Justice Department. Merrick Garland, the attorney general, stepped aside from this case. He brought in a career prosecutor to take a look at it. The weaponization of the Justice Department happened under the former guy, not under this guy.


How many Democratic presidential candidates were indicted under “the former guy?” Zero.

GEOFF BENNETT: What about that, that it makes it harder for Donald Trump to  make the argument — of course, he’ll make the argument — but it's harder for him to make a convincing argument that he's being railroaded when it's happening in — on his home turf, as I said?

DAVID BROOKS: You went to law school. I didn't. But I don't know how you get a fair jury. Like, does anybody in this country not have an opinion about Donald Trump? So I don't know how that's going to work.

He's going to make the argument. And from the judgment from today, a lot of people are going to accept the argument. We looked at the tweets already. If you're running against Donald Trump for president, your job is to take this day and say, “see, that guy's not qualified to be president.” That's like, simple.

Does Ron DeSantis do that? No. Does Tim Scott do that? No. They're all — they're all jumping on the, it's prosecutive — it's weaponizing the justice system. They're jumping on that, Mike Lee in the Senate. Glenn Youngkin, the supposedly mature and moderate governor of Virginia, he was like ""selective prosecution.""

And so the party is rallying around. And one of the things Donald Trump has been having trouble doing is raising money. And the thing he knows that can help him raise money is getting indicted. And so he got indicted in New York, and he raised like — something like $12 million.

As soon as the indictment comes down, he's got a video, he's got the direct mail. He's making hay while the sun shines. And so he's using this as a political gift, which, for the time being, it seems to be, at least in the Republican Party.

RUTH MARCUS: But we knew he would. But the really sickening thing is what you say about the rest of the party rallying around him.

If— I know — we all know why they're doing it. We all know they're doing it not because they believe it, but because they understand it to be in their political self-interest.

1594,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",20 Years Ago: Media Saluted Hillary’s  ‘Candid’ Scandal Fairy Tale,"June 10th, 2023 8:55 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2023/06/10/20-years-ago-media-saluted-hillarys-candid-scandal-fairy-tale,"Journalists like to describe themselves as “speaking truth to power” — at least when they want to give themselves an excuse to engage in full-throated political activism. But that sense of mission only seems to apply when they want to scream at conservatives; the media elite have little interest in puncturing the self-serving lies of their liberal heroes.

Which brings us to how the networks covered former First Lady Hillary Clinton’s memoir, Living History, twenty years ago this week. In June 2003, Hillary had been in the Senate for two and a half years, and there was little doubt she hungered to be President. But she also had some famously unfinished business from her role in the early days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which led to her husband’s impeachment five years earlier, in 1998.

 In January of 1998, as news broke of Bill Clinton’s affair with Lewinsky, Hillary appeared on NBC’s Today show to claim it was all a fraud and blame conservatives for concocting the story. “The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for President.”

But in August of that year, Bill Clinton confessed the truth of his affair with Lewinsky, opening him to perjury and obstruction charges (since he’d denied the affair under oath when deposed as part of a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state worker who said Clinton exposed himself to her in a hotel room in 1991). Bill Clinton’s forced confession meant Hillary’s attempt to blame the Lewinsky story on a “vast right-wing conspiracy” was either evidence of her extreme gullibility, or a cynical lie.

Hillary’s book and subsequent media tour gave her a chance to present a reasonably palatable excuse for her statement, even if it matched neither the existing record nor common sense. The kickoff was to be a prime time Sunday night ABC News special hosted by Barbara Walters on June 8, the day before Living History went on sale. But a few days earlier, a copy was “leaked” to the Associated Press, which on June 3 reported — without any skepticism — that Hillary only learned the truth of Bill’s affair with Lewinsky on August 15, 1998, two days before he had to testify before a grand jury.

“Mrs. Clinton said that up until that August morning when her husband confessed, she believed he was being railroaded and had merely been foolish by paying any attention to Lewinsky. She was incredulous that he would endanger their marriage and family. ‘I was dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that I’d believed him at all,’ the AP’s Calvin Woodward wrote.

The timing of the AP story ensured the network morning shows would heavily feature this claim the next morning (June 4). “Hillary Clinton’s new book bombshell,” ABC’s Charlie Gibson trumpeted on Good Morning America. “Bill’s confession made her gulp for air, cry and yell at him: ‘Why did you lie to me?’”

“Mrs. Clinton writes candidly about the moment her husband admitted he’d been unfaithful,” NBC’s Sara James told Today viewers that morning.

“She’s very candid about a very personal matter,” agreed co-host Katie Couric.

On CNN that afternoon, Jonathan Karl told viewers that Hillary had only “unwittingly” blamed conservatives back in January 1998: “Mrs. Clinton believed him, and famously went on national television, unwittingly repeating his lies and denouncing the reports about Lewinsky as the product of a vast right-wing conspiracy.”

As NewsBusters’s Brent Baker noted the next day in the Media Research Center’s CyberAlert newsletter, there was no suggestion in any of this coverage “that she [Hillary] owes an apology for smearing conservatives in her Today show appearance, when at the time everyone knew the Lewinsky story was accurate.”

In the same missive, Baker also pointed out that in all of the morning, evening and cable news coverage, “none suggested that if she really was in the dark for eight months, she must be one of the stupidest people alive.”

According to the AP’s account, Hillary only learned the “truth” from her husband “on the morning of Saturday, August 15, 1998, [when] he woke her up, paced at the bedside, and ‘told me for the first time that the situation was much more serious than he had previously acknowledged.’”

But the night before, on the August 14, 1998 NBC Nightly News, correspondent Andrew Mitchell reported that “close friends say she knew everything from Day One and still went on NBC in January to deny all.” Yet NBC’s own reporting from 1998 didn’t stop NBC’s anchors and correspondents from believing Hillary’s convenient new version five years later.

In fact, when Mitchell herself reported on the book on the June 4, 2003 Nightly News, she never doubted Hillary’s new account. Mitchell’s report instead presented Hillary’s own press secretary, Lisa Caputo, as a confirming source: “She didn’t know,” NBC viewers heard Caputo say. “I mean, I remember that time very well. She had no idea.”

In the days that followed, Barbara Walters talked about her upcoming special on several shows, including ABC’s The View. She saluted Hillary’s courage and described the revelations as heartfelt: “You know how hard it is — it’s one thing to even write something in a book, it’s another thing to have to say it and to have to dig into yourself and discuss your feelings. And she does....There are places she could have fudged it, and she talks about how she felt.”

On the June 5 Late Show with David Letterman, Walter also enthused over Hillary’s public record: “She’s been a very good Senator, and very low key....She’s been a very hard-working junior Senator....I think she’ll be re-elected. I think she’s done a good job.”

 When Sunday night came around, Americans tuned in to an hour-long infomercial for Hillary. “You became First Lady like no other First Lady before you. You had your own interests, you got involved in public policy.” Walters gushed. “Did you realize what you were getting into?”

There was no “speaking truth to power,” not even when Hillary claimed about Whitewater, Travelgate, the cattle futures scandal, etc., that “everything that was thrown at me, everything that was said, turned out to be without basis in fact.” Everything?

“I don’t think people realize how strong your faith is,” Walters fawned.

The rest of Hillary’s book tour was more of the same. In her interview with Hillary, Time’s Nancy Gibbs presumed the Clintons were victims: “In the book, you have a lot to say about forgiveness. Have you forgiven Ken Starr?” referring to the independent counsel who investigated the President.

Then on June 12, Gibbs told radio host Don Imus that despite Bill’s confession, Hillary still blamed the vast right-wing conspiracy: “I think she still sees this as a very big, orchestrated, well-funded, powerful entity that she’s doing battle against. That was the impression that I got as I talked to her, that it looms very large for her.”

On NBC’s Today, Katie Couric ran Hillary segments three mornings in a row (on June 9, 10 and 11). By the third morning, she was lobbying Hillary to run for the White House herself: “You have said, Senator Clinton, you will not run for President in 2004. What if your party drafted you?...What if it did?...Would you run for Vice President in 2004?...What about 2008?”

“It’s very flattering that people like you ask me this question,” Hillary told Couric.

Journalists aren’t wrong when they pose difficult questions to conservatives and Republicans. But they act as partisan tools when they fail to hold liberals equally accountable — as they did 20 years ago when they willingly served the ambition of a former First Lady and Democratic Senator with her eye on the White House.

Today, it's nowhere close to that. On Tuesday, they issued a barely disguised press release for the radical left, under the headline ""LGBTQ+ Americans are under attack, Human Rights Campaign declares in state of emergency warning.""

Reporter Hannah Schoenbaum -- who touts the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association in her Twitter bio -- began: ""The Human Rights Campaign declared a state of emergency for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. on Tuesday and released a guidebook pointing to laws it deems discriminatory in each state, along with 'know your rights' information and resources to help people relocate to states with stronger LGBTQ+ protections.""

HRC boss Kelley Robinson is the only person quoted in this article. There is no space for conservative dissent from this ""state of emergency"" baloney. It continued: 


A recent Associated Press analysis found that many bills seeking to ban or restrict gender-affirming health care for transgender youth, who have been the primary targets of state legislation this year, sprang not from grassroots or constituent demand, but from the pens of a few powerful conservative interest groups.

Just a few days into Pride Month, the campaign said it’s taking action in response to an “unprecedented and dangerous” spike in discriminatory legislation sweeping state houses this year, with more than 525 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced and more than 70 signed into law so far in 2023 — more than double last year’s number....

As many LGBTQ+ Americans are celebrating their identities this month against the backdrop of a dizzying array of new restrictions, some trans people and their families are scrambling to flee their home states. Others have suddenly found themselves without access to medical care many credit as life-saving, and are turning to often-dangerous “do-it-yourself” hormone treatments to avoid involuntarily reversing their physical transitions.


On Wednesday, AP followed up on this Dangerous Conservatives trend with a story titled ""As conservatives target schools, LGBTQ+ kids and students of color feel less safe."" A trio of reporters began by touting Harmony Kennedy in Tennessee, who uttered the usual baloney about black history being ""removed"" and LGBTQ ""banned."" They don't fact-check the leftists at AP, they promote them: 


“When I heard they were removing African American history, banning LGBTQ, I almost started crying,” said Harmony, 16. “We’re not doing anything to anybody. Why do they care what we personally prefer, or what we look like?”


They promoted a transgender student and a gay student with the same template, that conservatives are making children unsafe: ""As conservative politicians and activists push for limits on discussions of race, gender and sexuality, some students say the measures targeting aspects of their identity have made them less welcome in American schools — the one place all kids are supposed to feel safe."" They also took this narrative to Twitter: 


For many students, new measures restricting how schools address race, gender and sexuality are having deeply personal effects. Some students of color and LGBTQ+ kids feel like their very existence is being rejected. https://t.co/AXQKfMxssx
— The Associated Press (@AP) June 7, 2023

Leo Burchell, a transgender student in Pennsylvania, had teachers’ support when he transitioned in 2020. Then, the school barred using students’ chosen pronouns without parental permission. It feels like a shrinking of the space where he’d felt safe. https://t.co/BWyJj5CtTg pic.twitter.com/VHdKvIkxaB

Ironically, Amanpour’s guest, Democratic Senator Chris Coons (DE) spent his air time promoting a bipartisan bill for a carbon border tax.

Christiane Amanpour commenced the segment by describing the harm caused to innocent civilians by the smoke and segued into a discussion on climate change. “So, do you think something like this, the actual clear and present public health danger that you talk about, and the people are talking about, is actually something tangible that can bring on board climate skeptics, deniers, reluctance, whatever we want to call them?” Amanpour questioned, displaying her distaste for those who might not agree.

 





 

“I hope so.” Coons replied, “As you may know, Christiane, I co-founded the Climate Solutions Caucus here several years ago. It's a bipartisan group of 14 senators, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, where, as a group, we agree that the climate is changing because of human activity, and we have to come together to do something about it.”

Amanpour remained unconvinced that Republicans could care about the climate. She continued:


OK. Senator, so, I understand that you could probably get some good -- and you have done bipartisan support for this, because it's outside the borders of the United States, but in the United States there's still so many who are reluctant, you know, on-on the other side of the aisle to talk about a carbon tax or any of these big mitigating possibilities.


Amanpour did not want to leave her audience under the impression that preventing pollution was a bipartisan issue. She immediately inserted her opinion that Republicans, “the other side of the aisle,” were holding back progress and asserted that they only supported the bill because it was, “outside the borders of the United States.”

 She poorly disguised her attempt to discredit the seven Republicans who addressed the issue of carbon admissions alongside the seven Democrats. “So, how do you expect your own country, you know, fully on board?” Amanpour questioned, still skeptical that anyone other than Democrats, much less the entire country, would favor carbon reductions.

Coons responded by talking about the progress already made towards a more environmentally friendly economy, avoiding Amanpour’s prompt to deprecate Republicans. He spoke highly of the efforts of both his Democratic and Republican colleagues and maintained that his bill was bipartisan.

Unable to convince Coons to blame Republicans for the haze and air pollution, Amanpour changed the conversation to China, which pollutes more than the U.S.

Their conversation began with the dangers of the smoke drifting across the East Coast. She then connected the smoke and air pollution to climate change, despite reports that Canadian officials are ramping up arson investigations. Finally, she addressed Republicans as deniers of climate change and generally opposed to any carbon-reducing policy, attempting to connect Republicans to the smoke pollution.

Amanpour’s assertions may have been more believable if she had not chosen to base them on a perfectly bipartisan, pro-environmental policy.

Amanpour and Company’s anti Republican bias was made possible because of a sponsorship from Navage. Their contact information is linked.

Amanpour and Company

6/9/2023

11:07 p.m. Eastern

CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Athena Jones reporting there in a rare example of bipartisan policy along with Republican Kevin Cramer. Senator Chris Coons recently introduced a bill that’ll lay the groundwork for America's first carbon border tax. And he's joining me now from Washington. Senator, Welcome to the program.

SEN. CHRIS COON (D-DE): Great to be on with you again, Christiane.

AMANPOUR: Yea. Can I just ask you, because now we know that the -- you know, the air is moving down south towards you, towards Washington, and all sorts of EPA alerts are at their highest, can you describe? I mean, what it is it like where you are? Is it difficult to breathe?

COONS: Well, I went for a walk here outside this morning in Washington, you can smell the smoke in the air, it is hazy. In my home state of Delaware, it's even worse and -- where my youngest, Margaret, is a recent college graduate in New York City, it's a complete blanket of haze. My family was sending images back and forth between the five of us in the last day or two.
This is a real public health challenge and a reminder that climate change has dramatic consequences. The vast wildfires out of control in Canada are impacting the entire East Coast of the United States. And for folks who are particularly vulnerable, who have asthma or other breathing difficulties, this is a critical issue.

AMANPOUR: So, do you think something like this, the actual clear and present public health danger that you talk about, and the people are talking about, is actually something tangible that can bring on board climate skeptics, deniers, reluctants, whatever we want to call them?

CHRIS COONS: I hope so. As you may know, Christiane, I co-founded the Climate Solutions Caucus here several years ago. It's a bipartisan group of 14 senators, seven Republicans, seven Democrats, where, as a group, we agree that the climate is changing because of human activity, and we have to come together to do something about it.

The bill you referenced that Senator Cramer and I just introduced has a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, and it would direct the Department of Energy, the U.S. federal government, to begin a mission standard testing so that we've got data on the emissions intensity of U.S. manufactured heavy industry products like steel and aluminum, glass, and concrete, and to gather that data from our partners and allies, like the U.K. and E.U. and Canada, and our competitors like Russia, China, India, that's laying the technical groundwork or foundation for our carbon border adjustment mechanism.

The E.U. is already well on its way to having such a mechanism in place that will impose tariffs on imported goods into the E.U., including potentially from the United States. And I've had several important conversations with national leaders, with climate advocates, with legislators from the E.U., U.K., Canada and other countries about how we could pull together and have a common carbon club of shared emissions reduction ambition.

We can use trade and potential tariffs as a way to bring into compliance our closest partners and allies and to impose costs on the heavy industrial products of countries like Russia and China that don’t reduce emissions.

AMANPOUR: OK. Senator, so, I understand that you could probably get some good -- and you have done bipartisan support for this, because it's outside the borders of the United States, but in the United States there's still so many who are reluctant, you know, on-on the other side of the aisle to talk about a carbon tax or any of these big mitigating possibilities.

COONS: That's right.

AMANPOUR: So, how do you expect your own country, you know, fully on board?

COONS: So, first, we've just made the biggest move forward in terms of climate ambition, in not just American history but in world history when President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $369 billion of incentives to transition towards a cleaner energy economy here in the United States. That's an important first step, to show the world that we're serious.

But to your point, Christiane, I am not trying to impose a carbon tax. We’re trying to measure the emissions reductions that have already happened in the United States because of our regulations, and then advantage cleaner or lower emissions, heavy industrial products. So, for example, American made steel and aluminum should not face any tariffs, whereas perhaps steel and aluminum coming from Russia or China that are intensive in their emissions would, and imports from the E.U. or Canada or U.K. wouldn't because they have regulatory schemes because of their carbon taxes and because of their regulations that are comparably low emissions to ours. I know it's a little complicated, but I think there is a way for us to harmonize our approaches to climate ambition across these open market democracies that are also close partners and allies.

AMANPOUR: So, let's talk about China, because it's, it’s clearly a very big player, and most of the China, you know, experts, including the Biden administration climate czar, John Kerry, basically state the obvious, that without China's cooperation none of this will come to pass.

COONS: Exactly.

AMANPOUR: There are distinctly frosty relations between the United States and China right now. I mean, worse than frosty.

COONS: That's right.

AMANPOUR: Do you see anything attempts in the -- attempts at a thaw that the U.S. is trying to project that could bear any fruit?

COONS: So, look, I am always an optimist about that possibility, but this is an approach that doesn't require warmer or closer relations between the United States and China. That's part of the beauty of an approach that says, if you want to access the American market, you have to prove that you have low emissions heavy industrial products. The thing that is most likely to bend the curve of emissions in China and India is market forces through trade.
So, again, Christiane, let's just imagine for a moment if the E.U., U.K., U.S., Canada, South Korea, Australia, all aligned around low emissions approaches to how we manufacture steel and aluminum, glass and cement, heavy industrial products and to access our markets, China and India would have to demonstrate, and Russia, that they are reducing their industrial emissions. That will drive them to change their emissions profiles, to slow down the rate at which they're currently building a record number of coal fired power plants. That's the thing that is going to drive global reductions in emissions more than any agreement, because I frankly think our relations may continue to be strained or even as you put it, frosty for years to come.

AMANPOUR: Well –

COONS: So, using –

AMANPOUR: -- maybe frosty was –

COONS: -- free market, using trade might well work.

AMANPOUR: OK.

COONS: And our agreements so far have not.

AMANPOUR: OK. But there's still trade problems between the United States and China. President Biden hasn't lifted some of the mechanisms and tariffs that President Trump imposed, and there seems to be a real sense that this China administration of President Xi is very different from the predecessors trying, you know, very hardline negotiating with the United States.

COONS: Correct.

AMANPOUR: Do you believe that the U.S. is having any success with its attempts to reach out or not, whether China will accept it, as we speak, there have been near misses both involving Chinese and American, you know, naval assets and air assets?

COONS: That's right. Christiane, we're in a very dangerous period in U.S. China relations. There have been, as you said, a number of very near misses on the seas and in the air, and we are trying to reopen the lines of dialogue simply to deal with the potential for escalation in the event there were a midair collision caused by reckless conduct by a Chinese pilot, for example.
Those Section 232 tariffs, the tariffs that were imposed by President Trump that are still in place on Chinese industrial products are also still in place on some imports from our close partners and allies. And Katherine Thai, the U.S. trade representative, is negotiating with the E.U., with the U.K., with other partners on potentially reducing or eliminating those tariffs and moving forward with something like an agreement on sustainable steel and aluminum.
This bill that I just introduced with my Republican partner, Senator Cramer, would advantage the manufacturing of U.S. based low emissions, heavy industrial products and potentially, if we work this out, reduced tariffs on things coming into this country from our partners and allies in U.K, Canada, E.U. but retain high tariffs on high emissions imports from countries like China or Russia.

1598,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",My Plan for the Transgenders,"June 9th, 2023 7:04 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/r-emmett-tyrrell-jr/2023/06/09/my-plan-transgenders,"WASHINGTON -- Some time ago, I wrote that there was a very easy and suave way to solve the trans guys’ yearning for an opportunity to compete against the girls, who now dominate women’s sports.

My solution will end the heartless intimidation of these tender youths -- the guys, not the girls. It will allow the guys to thrive against the conventional ways of female sports, which can be brutal. Having now researched the problem carefully, I take it that the word “bullying” comes very close to the heart of the matter. Mature, serious and sober do-good organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union rarely take up the issue of trans guys in girls’ sports without mentioning bullying. The bullying comes from the girls, not from the guys. Some of these girls can be brutes.

The guys may be bold enough to show up at a girls’ athletic events wearing a girls’ frilly competitive outfit. Think of the feminine frills worn by female tennis stars or the tattoos worn by women boxers. Yet even the toughest transgender guy has got to be shaken after one of the burly girls snickers at him/her or offers to hold his/her towel. There are dozens of ways to bully a transgender athlete, and no matter how aloof or calloused he or she might be, still every slight has its affect.

Recently, Deirdre Schifeling, the ACLU’s national political director, spoke out against a Republican anti-trans drift and in doing so revealed the ACLU’s obsession with the vulnerability of transgender youth. As she put it, “Today’s vote was a cynical attack against some of the most vulnerable youth in our country.” Her ally from the House floor, Rep. Donald Payne, chimed in, chastising Congressional Republicans for “nothing more than an attempt to score cheap political points and bully transgender youth.” Well said, Ms. Schifeling and Rep. Payne, who speak for many liberal-minded people. The bullying of transgenders has got to stop. Yet how will it end?

This is where my solution comes in. Years ago, when the female of the species began swimming competitively, they were faced with many of the same problems that trans guys are faced with today. Some of the girls thought they could swim as fast as the males. Some still do believe this. I doubt that the girls wanted to dress with the boys. People were more sensible then, but some thought they would compete with the boys. Good sense prevailed, and the girls settled for competing with other girls, while the boys competed with the boys and never thought of competing with the girls. A similar evolution took place in track and field and other sports. Why cannot a similar evolution take place among those who wish to transform their gender? Why cannot there be a third and, for that matter, a fourth category for the gender-revised athletes?

When I made my suggestion for the gender-revised some years ago, I thought I was going to be inundated by calls from the television stations of the nation and the newspapers. At least I thought there would be interest shown from the world of sport. My plan was greeted by thunderous silence. My suggestion would introduce a new category in sport for a sexually revised sector of our society that could compete with others who did not feel comfortable with things as they were and wanted change, change that would discomfit no one.

Well, even the trans guys would not endorse my plan. Even the ACLU was remaining mum, and I was counting on it. I figured if I could win the ACLU’s support, I might even win the Democratic Party’s support, or at least the Democratic Party as it is now constituted in California. My conclusion is straightforward. The trans guys who want to compete with the girls, however, are really interested in something other than liberation. They want to make a spectacle of themselves. They want to be at the center of a controversy that will change the face of sport in America. All I can say is that I tried.

1599,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","NBC Journo Plays P.R. Assistant for Newsom Wanting to Arrest DeSantis, Pass Gun Grab","June 9th, 2023 6:16 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2023/06/09/nbc-journo-plays-pr-assistant-newsom-wanting-arrest-desantis-pass,"Between Wednesday’s Morning Joe on MSNBC and NBC’s Today from Thursday, NBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff played footsie with fellow California leftist and Governor Gavin Newsom (D), serving as a welcome mat for Newsom to promote a massive gun grab and hint at arresting 2024 Republican presidential candidate and Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL) if he set foot in the Golden State.

Wednesday morning on MSNBC featured the DeSantis portion, which resulted in co-host Joe Scarborough falsely claiming DeSantis put illegal immigrants on the streets when he flew a group of them to Sacramento seeing as how California was so open to illegal immigration.

 





 

In the first of two exchanges, Soboroff noted “[t]hese flights of” what he called “asylum seekers” (versus illegal immigrants) “have been described as state-sanctioned kidnapping by the attorney general of this state” and reminded Newsom of his tweet agreeing with his AG and calling DeSantis “a small pathetic man”.

He then gave Newsom the floor to further taunt DeSantis: “I think I’m being generous while empathetic. Very generous. He’s just weakness masquerading as strength. Yeah. He’s flailing. Desperate for attention.”

Without pushback, Newsom continued to dither away, falsely claiming these illegals were lured “under false pretense” because “I don’t think this, I know this, I talked to the migrants” that DeSantis “lied to them, took them into another state by bus, and then took ‘em on a chartered flight to Sacramento, lying to them that they had help on the other side, knocked on the door, and they left these migrants right there on the steps.”

“What kind of human being does that,” Newsom added.

In the second clip, Soboroff asked about arresting DeSantis: “Ron DeSantis is going to be landing in this city later this month to hold a fundraiser for his presidential campaign. Should he be worried that law enforcement officials in this state will arrest him?”

Incredibly, Newsom played dumb, insisting “we’re getting into hyperbole” while also hinting he could actually pull that stunt: “Bottom line is, we’re for accountability.”

The pair continued with Soboroff’s faux pushback, followed by a long, unchallenged, and uninterrupted Newsom response (click “expand”):


SOBOROFF: Well, just respectfully, I mean, I don’t think it’s hyperbole. You’re the one raising the issue of criminality, potentially.

NEWSOM: We have — potentially? Yeah. And we have to do the investigation, and that — so, one — when it’s ready, aim, fire. Not ready, fire, aim. And that’s his approach. Our approach is to seek first — to collect all the facts. But on the basis of facts that were provided, and, by the way, I didn’t take this in the third party — right — I was there with these folks directly and listened to how they — I mean, you know, human beings used as pawns for a guy’s political advancement. That’s pretty sad and pathetic. And — and so, I — I take this very seriously and as I said, we are not Martha’s Vineyard. I love Martha’s Vineyard, but we’re not Martha’s — this is California. Fourth or fifth largest economy on the planet Earth. We mean business, so Ron DeSantis should know that. And everyone that has been part of this, they may have more direct accountability and culpability, should know that we mean business and we’re not backing away from getting the facts and holding those accountable if they broke the laws in the state of California.


Fast-forward just over 24 hours to Today and co-host Hoda Kotb introduced the gun portion by boasting “a historic announcement by California Governor Gavin Newsom that could affect the country when it comes to gun control.”

Soboroff’s lead-in was pure liberal P.R.:


Every week in this country, there is another mass shooting, but in the aftermath, little seems to be done to stop more of them. Now, California Governor Gavin Newsom is taking an unprecedented step which he says will do just that. He’s proposing a new 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that, if passed, would restrict access to guns in all 50 states. 


His first question in this section was bland: “Why a constitutional amendment and why now?”

 Newsom dismissed the legitimacy of federal courts, insisting “why now is pretty self-evident that a lot of laws...being rolled back by the federal courts.”

Soboroff instead gave him an assist: “To be clear, you’re not calling for the abolition of the Second Amendment.”

As for the details, Soboroff bragged Newsom was “fed up with Congress’s inability to act” and thus “proposing something never done before on gun control” with a constitutional amendment to “implement four measures,” including a “ban” on “the sale of assault rifles to civilians.”

Soboroff accepted a lame answer for how it’ll happen: “It’s possible because their constituency demands it.” The NBC reporter backed it up with a Fox News poll.

Soboroff only pushed back near the end, but cushioned the blow (click “expand”):


SOBOROFF [TO NEWSOM]: You know very well what the critics will say about this. California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. In the first month of the year, between Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park, 18 people were killed. That’s what they’re going to say. What do we need this 28th Amendment for?

NEWSOM: Well, California’s gun death rate today is 73 percent lower than Texas. These federal judges want to turn America into Texas. We cannot let that happen.

SOBOROFF: The 19th Amendment to the Constitution that gave women the right to vote, it took 40 years or so. Do you think that 28th Amendment, if it’s passed, will it happen in your lifetime?

NEWSOM: I hope so. If you don’t start, it will never happen.


Back live, Soboroff conceded that “to even get this amendment off the ground, California would need to be joined by two-thirds of the other states” and is thus “a very uphill battle.”

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) issued a letter to embattled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew “demanding immediate answers” about a recent report that TikTok funneled the personal information of TikTok users to Chinese-based servers. According to a bombshell report by Forbes, TikTok stored the social security numbers and other financial information of Americans, in communist China. The report contradicts Chew’s sworn congressional testimony in which he claimed the U.S. data is held in Virginia, a point highlighted in the damning letter.

“We are disturbed by TikTok’s pattern of misleading or inaccurate responses regarding serious matters related to users’ safety and national security, and request that TikTok correct and explain its previous, incorrect claims,” Blackburn and Blumenthal wrote of TikTok’s under oath and public claims that American consumer data was stored in the U.S. and backups were in Singapore.

""I'm glad to see a bipartisan effort to hold TikTok accountable for its dubious statements about American users' data,"" said MRC Free Speech America & MRC Business Director Michael Morris. ""But as FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has said in the past, taking TikTok's assurances about user data being held safely in servers at face value is not enough as this recent report shows. Carr even suggested that a national ban would be the only solution to TikTok's misdeeds.""

Forbes reported on May 31 that TikTok knowingly used internal databases from its parent company, communist Chinese government-tied ByteDance. ByteDance is at the center of a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. following congressional demands that TikTok separate itself from ByteDance or face a complete U.S. ban. However, TikTok executives, including Chew, have repeatedly downplayed its financial ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

“These reports directly contradict statements you and other TikTok representatives have made to the public and under oath before Congress about where TikTok stores U.S. user data and the ability of employees in China to access that information,” the bipartisan senators continued while blasting the social media giant for what they described as a “pattern of misleading or inaccurate responses from TikTok to Congressional oversight.”

Chew testified in a contentious congressional hearing in March where he was pressed over whether TikTok user data was sent to communist Chinese servers. When questioned about ByteDance’s financial ties and where TikTok data was held, Chew claimed, “American data has always been stored in Virginia and Singapore in the past.” Later in his testimony, Chew added, “I don’t know of any other company in my industry who is offering this level of transparency.”

Blackburn and Blumenthal blasted Chew’s omission of the Chinese servers, and wrote, “Nowhere in your response did you mention that TikTok stores user data in China, or that information about U.S. users— including sensitive information like photos and driver’s licenses or reports containing illegal materials like child sexual abuse materials — would be shared on Lark, and therefore accessible to ByteDance employees.” According to The New York Times, Lark is a messaging app used by both TikTok and ByteDance employees to exchange information, including the personal information of users.

The two senators concluded by demanding a series of answers to questions related to the servers and ordered TikTok to answer by June 16, 2023.

1601,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Scarborough Touts Wild Conspiracy Trump Sold Classified Docs to Saudis,"June 9th, 2023 5:30 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/peter-kotara/2023/06/09/scarborough-touts-wild-conspiracy-trump-sold-classified-docs,"As America began to reel from the political firestorm caused by the Justice Department’s indictment of former President Donald Trump, resident MSNBC bloviator Joe Scarborough took to his Friday morning show along with former Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill (MO) to promote a wild and baseless conspiracy theory that Trump tried to sell classified documents to Saudi Arabia.

The far-left MSNBC hosts pounced on the indictment, characterizing Trump as “a direct threat to national security,” and accused him of selling the classified documents to Saudi Arabia in exchange for the Saudis’ decision to lower oil production, supposedly in an attempt to make oil prices spike and thus hurt President Biden’s popularity.





McCaskill ranted:

“He is so dangerous, so dangerous to our national security … one of the things, as Jen pointed out, is that he could use them to continue to curry favor with Saudi Arabia. And what could Saudi Arabia do for Donald Trump right now? They could cut production of oil and raise gas prices.”

This was not the first time MSNBC has promoted this theory. Nicolle Wallace recently peddled the same speculation.

The problem with this, however, was that there is exactly zero evidence to support it. So much so, that fellow far-left extremist outlet The Washington Post reported that investigators saw “no discernible business interest” in the documents. Wallace, McCaskill, and Scarborough had their minds stuck so far deep in their liberal fantasy bubble that they even ignored their own friendly outlet.

Scarborough imagined even further, implying that Saudi Arabia’s recently decision to decrease oil production against President Biden’s wishes was all part of Trump’s scheme to sell them documents:

“He cut production, prices went down anyway. Everything they were warning him about came to fruition … I think for many, the question may answer itself.”

The question in fact did answer itself, with the indictment being released. Nowhere in its nearly 50 pages does special counsel Jack Smith mention the Saudis or any conspiracy by Trump to sell classified documents.

As for the Saudis snubbing Biden, the answer was really simple. Biden himself, as a candidate, infamously called the country – one of America’s most important allies in the Middle East -  a “pariah” and said he would make them “pay the price” for the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It was not hard to figure out that a nation directly threatened by Biden would not want to help Biden or work with him. Since Trump wasn’t on the market for selling top secret government documents, perhaps a better investment for the Saudis would be to research to find a cure for Scarborough and MSNBC’s Trump Derangement Syndrome.

MSNBC’s Morning Joe 

06/09/23

7:10 AM ET

(…)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: These people suggesting that he didn’t have malicious intent in mind, they’re ignoring a very, very long paper trail.

CLAIRE MCCASKILL: He is so dangerous, he is so dangerous to our national security. And it is just fascinating to me that people in Congress who understand the consequences of what he has done and how he has done it, continue to defend him. 

I mean, you know, we've talked about what he would do with these documents. One of the things, as Jen pointed out, is that he could use them to continue to curry favor with Saudi Arabia. 

And what could Saudi Arabia do for Donald Trump right now? They could cut production of oil and raise gas prices. Nothing could hurt Joe Biden more than raising gas prices next year, three, four months from the election. And Trump knows that. He is willing to do anything to do two things: promote himself and make money, country be damned. 


SCARBOROUGH: Yeah, and by the way, the headline, it's so fascinating that you say that, Claire, because on the Drudge Report, there are all the headlines about the indictments, but at the very top, the headline, Saudi crowned prince threatened major economic pain on the U.S. amid oil feuds. And by the way, what was Donald Trump angry about regarding his son-in-law, Jared Kushner? 

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Yeah, yep, yep.

SCARBOROUGH: That Jared Kushner got $2 billion for his fund from the Saudis and he didn't get a cut of it. He was, according to reports, enraged that he didn't get a cut of the money that Jared went out and raised after he left the White House. 

Maybe this is again speculation, we're not exactly sure why they're not- not communicating as much, but there was a real bitterness that he didn't get a cut of that money. And there's no doubt he wants a cut, not only of that money, but of Saudi money. 

And let me just say one other thing, too. Talking to my sources in the Middle East, and I asked them, after the Saudis cut production to raise oil prices, I asked them all, what were you doing? What were you thinking? Biden goes over, he brings -- with political damage done to his political brand in America, he gets the crowned prince out of the corner, goes over, gives him a fist bump. And the crowned prince turns around a couple of weeks later, stabs Biden in the back, forgive the -- the description, undermines Joe Biden. 

Why would he do that? And you talk to oil ministers, talk to other people in the Middle East. They were counselling him not to do it. They said it made no sense. And he cut production, prices went down anyway. Everything they were warning him about came to fruition. So why in the world would the Saudi crowned prince cut oil production when everybody else in OPEC was telling him not to do it. Everybody else in OPEC was saying, this made no sense. Everybody else was saying that this is not the time.

Well, you all think about it. 

BRZEZINSKI: Yeah.

SCARBOROUGH: I think, for many, the question may answer itself.

1602,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",The View: Pro-Lifers Against Trans Surgeries Are ‘Killing Our Children',"June 9th, 2023 3:37 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2023/06/09/view-pro-lifers-against-trans-surgeries-are-killing-our,"Fortunately, Friday’s edition of ABC’s The View was pre-recorded and thus spared America their hot takes on the second indictment of former President Trump. But in its place, the cast collectively launched into unhinged screeds defending drag shows, proclaiming the virtues of so-called “gender-affirming” care, and smearing pro-lifers by suggesting their refusal to placate to a mental illness meant they’re “killing our children.”

The most off-the-rails cast member was moderator Whoopi Goldberg, who would randomly spiral out of control in rage-fueled fits. “You are telling me that I don't know my family. You are telling me you know my kid. I’m telling you: you don't know my kid. You don’t know what I'm going through, you don’t know what I need, and you're not asking me,” she shrieked, condemning opposition to so-called “gender-affirming” surgeries that leave children mutilated and at risk for other health complications.

Addressing opponents directly, she accused them of “scaring my kids” and “making them feel like they don't deserve to be here and that they don't deserve to live!” “This is on your hands! This is on your hands!” she screamed.

Goldberg’s tirade peaked as they went to a commercial break when she declared: “You are killing our children!”

The lunacy also extended to defending drag shows with hypocrisy by simultaneously arguing that no one was bringing kids to drag shows and that drag queen story hours were great events.

 





 

Faux conservative co-host Ana Navarro suggested the Republican Party’s electoral strategy was about “driving people to the polls through fear, through anger, through angst, through the stress” and with “the paranoia and hysteria that drag queens are coming for your children.”

Blowing a fuse, Navarro shouted: “Drag queens don't even like children! They don't tip and they don't drink, you know! They don't tip and they don't drink!” Which drew applause and laughter from the liberal audience.

“And to me, this is so contrary to the idea of parental choice,” she argued in favor of parents bringing their kids to drag shows. “No child is driving themselves to a drag show!”

The wires appeared to be crossed on which narrative they were using because co-host Sara Haines falsely asserted: “People aren’t taking kids to drag shows.” But she did immediately admit, “There are drag readings, where it's children's reading material, and they're reading and entertaining them because drag is a performance art.”

Navarro admitted that “one little girl” had been spotted at a drag show, but suggested it was overblown. Meanwhile, the 2023 MRC Bulldog Award winner, Libs of TikTok, has done tremendous work putting a spotlight on not only children being exposed to drag shows, but performing at them as well.

Haines also appeared to slip up as she discussed how she doesn’t let her young kids watch movies rated PG yet. “I love a drag show. Doesn't mean my kids belong there right now,” she said. The slip came as she explained why she wasn’t taking her kids to drag shows yet, catching herself in the process: “But that’s not because of the drag queens, it’s because of the sexually explicit – of the language and things. That’s all.”

On so-called “gender-affirming” care, Haines downplayed the practice as just “minor surgeries” and “breast reductions.” She also tried to dismiss how often these kind of procedures were carried out. “The infinitesimal amount of people getting minor surgeries. For example, 203 top surgery procedures were done on minors in 2021. 4,700 teenagers, 13 to 19,” she rhetorically scoffed.

Haines also flaunted her hatred for pro-lifers, suggesting they didn’t practice what they preached: “This the party that claims to be pro-life, yet the lives living here need the help they get, they say none.” She even had the nerve to proclaim that pro-lifers “need to educate themselves on what things they're saying.”

ANA NAVARRO: Well, now they're back to the same anti-gay playbook. In 2024, the issue is transgender, because we're passed gay marriage. That ship has sailed. And it's this idea of driving people to the polls through fear, through anger, through angst, through the stress, through the -- you know, the paranoia and hysteria that drag queens are coming for your children.

People, let me tell you this, drag queens don't even like children! They don't tip and they don't drink, you know! [Applause] They don't tip and they don't drink!

And to me this is so contrary to the idea of parental choice. No child is driving themselves to a drag show! And so I would say Ron DeSantis -- first, to all the drag queens, for the month of June, pride month, let’s celebrate by changing your names to Rhonda Santis.

[Applause]

But a – if – if –if –if – If taking a child to a drag show is such endangerment to that child, why aren’t you penalizing the parents for putting the child in danger? Leave the kids alone, man!

SARA HAINES: People aren’t taking kids to drag shows. There are drag readings, where it's children's reading material, and they're reading and entertaining them because drag is a performance art.

NAVARRO: No, no. There was one parent that showed up with one little girl and he’s been trying to close down--

HAINES: But in general, people just don't do that. I don't let my kids watch PG movies yet. I love a drag show. Doesn't mean my kids belong there right now. But that’s not because of the drag queens, it’s because of the sexually explicit – of the language and things. That’s all.

(…)

11:06:20 a.m. Eastern

HAINES: There's a lot of talk about, “They're going to come and perform a surgery.” The infinitesimal amount of people getting minor surgeries. For example, 203 top surgery procedures were done on minors in 2021. 4,700 teenagers, 13 to 19, had breast reductions. So, are we going to talk about this surgery, and this irreversible surgery being so bad when the percentage of people being affected? This the party that claims to be pro-life, yet the lives living here need the help they get, they say none.

GOLDBERG: But none of this is anybody's business!

[Applause]

[Crosstalk]

GOLDBERG: But this is the part that I don't understand. You are telling me that I don't know my family. You are telling me you know my kid. I’m telling you: you don't know my kid. You don’t know what I'm going through, you don’t know what I need, and you're not asking me.

You're not saying, hey, we're going to give you some money to make sure we have places where if your child comes and says, “listen, I need to talk to you, I can help you get to where you need to be!” You're not helping me. You are scaring my kids, you're making them feel like they don't deserve to be here and that they don't deserve to live! This is on your hands! This is on your hands! This is what we're dealing with!

11:09:16 a.m. Eastern

SUNNY HOSTIN: I also read Elliott Page's book. And I think that book – I hope everybody reads it, it's going to save lives, it’s going to explain what he went through, and there's one thing that he wrote about when he got his period when he was with his father skiing. And I thought I was terrified when I got my period at 11 years old. And I was with my dad. I didn't want to tell him.

Imagine being in the wrong body, imagine being born into a girl's body when you are a boy, and you are experiencing that, and you could have blockers, you could have had that and have avoided that experience.

HAINES: They have been using puberty blockers on CIS gender patients since the 1990s. So, people need to educate themselves on what things they're saying.

HOSITN: And why not do it for these kids?

GOLDBERG: But stop trying – You are killing our children! You are telling our kids they don't belong. They are not welcome. And God bless this table. I am going to fight – We are going to fight for everybody's right to be themselves here in America, because that's the promise of America. Be who you are.

I guess we can’t say that ALL of Hollywood is brainwashed. 

Actor Tyrese Gibson guest starred on BigBoyTV’s video podcast series last month to talk about the tenth Fast and Furious movie - Fast X -  that, at the time, wasn’t released yet. During his interview, Gibson called out Hollywood and exposed the industry’s pro-Satan agenda. 

Finally! A celebrity said what we’ve all been seeing. 

“They are trying to normalize the devil,"" Gibson stated in a now viral clip the episode. ""They are trying to populate — the devil is on the main stage at award shows and in every video — signs and symbols.""

Damn. Straight facts sir! 


Finally someone in Hollywood is exposing their pro-Satan agenda!!!!
DO. NOT. BE. FOOLED. pic.twitter.com/A7R0Og4u6o

In the last few years alone there’s been a plethora of different honors to Satan. Singer Sam Smith danced as a devil on stage at the Grammys. His performance paralleled one from singer Lil Nas X in 2021 when he straddled a devil and gave him a lapdance in one of his music videos. This year we also saw a release called, “Little Demon.” It was about an antichrist child of Satan. 

Our culture is spending more time praising Satan than even considering a relationship with Jesus, and it’s infiltrating all aspects of society.

In his interview, Gibson added the following:


And I say ‘you know what, we need to stop treating our relationship with Jesus like the little buddy that you talk to before you go to bed at night, and not be more vocal about all the things that God means to us and all of the things that God has brought us through.’ Because there’s been a lot of moments that you didn’t post about. But yet you know, ‘How did God decide to get me through this?’ They goin above and beyond to promote the devil and it’s pissing me off.


Me freakin' too, Mr. Gibson. Me too.

Unironically, Gibson was cut off and the subject changed just after he mentioned how vocal people are about celebrating the devil. There’s no more “goin down in the basement” to praise the devil. Nowadays people aren't ashamed of it. Immediately after that statement, BigBoy himself stated, “I do wanna come back and I wanna talk to you about “Fast X,” as well.

Quick diversion, sir. 

It’s honestly outrageous how the devil has become a topic of worship as of late. I mean, I’m sure you’ve all heard about Target releasing items that said “Satan Respects Pronouns.”

Y’all, this is a battle of good and evil.

1604,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",MSNBC Is 'Concerned' Trump Judge Will Not 'Oversee a Fair Trial',"June 9th, 2023 2:39 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/06/09/msnbc-concerned-trump-judge-will-not-oversee-fair-trial,"Gone are the days when questioning whether a judge in a Trump indictment case can be truly impartial is said to be unacceptable because the cast of MSNBC's Friday special coverage on the matter sounded the alarm whether Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon can truly be fair and neutral given some of her previous rulings.

Diaz-Balart presented the news to NBC senior executive editor for national security David Rohde and asked for his thoughts, “And now NBC can confirm indeed that Judge Aileen Cannon will be presiding over this case. Just thought, your reaction to that?”

 





 

Not thrilled with the news, Rohde declared that “I'm concerned and if she, you know, handles it through the trial she made some very unusual rulings in the course of the litigation surrounding the search warrant.”

Rohde is alluding to Cannon’s decision to appoint a special master back in September. After Diaz-Balart interjected to add that Cannon was “appointed by Trump,” Rohde declined to go that far, “So, Judge Cannon, you know, I want to be fair to her. Maybe she can, you know, rule in an unbiased way but she made several rulings overturned very quickly by her superiors in federal appellate court that were seen as unusual.”

Wrapping up his remarks, Rohde displayed an anti-Trump knee-jerk reflex when it came to defining what constitutes a fair trial, “She has a moment, you know, a chance here in American history to oversee a fair trial and I hope she does that.”

Co-hosting with Diaz-Balart was Ana Cabrera and she asked former top Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann, “Andrew, my understanding is judges like this would be selected randomly, so it just happened to end up back in her lap, but given her history in the case, would this be a situation in which because of public perception of, you know, whatever, they would choose to intentionally shift this away from her court?”

That was a question that the media wouldn’t dare ask in the New York case because the judge has a daughter that worked for the Biden campaign. 

After declaring that it was possible Cannon got the case because of her previous involvement in it, Weissmann raised the idea that she could be “asked to recuse herself because of her prior service on the case” and described Rohde’s assessment as “very polite.”

Weissmann attempted to argue that his criticisms of Cannon are not that of a partisan activist, “she was reversed not once, but twice by an extremely conservative appellate court and the decisions were, to put it bluntly, scathing. I mean, she really got the law completely wrong and that's not me saying that, that is the Court of Appeals.”

He concluded by declaring that Cannon does not appear to be up to the challenge, “So, the idea that she's back on the case, it would certainly be a very large challenge to see her rise to the occasion, ""I always thought after the first reversal she might rise to the occasion but that didn't happen and she had to be reversed again, so it will be interesting to see whether she stays on the case, I think that's still an open issue.” 

Cannon was presented with an unprecedented and politically sensitive case involving a former president who is currently running again, she issued a ruling, it got reversed, that isn’t definitive proof of partiality.

MSNBC The Indictment of Donald Trump

6/9/2023

11:27 AM ET

JOSE DIAZ-BALART: And now NBC can confirm indeed that Judge Aileen Cannon will be presiding over this case. Just thought, your reaction to that? 

DAVID ROHDE: I'm concerned and if she, you know, handles it through the trial she made some very unusual rulings in the course of the litigation surrounding the search warrant. 

DIAZ-BALART: Appointed by Trump. 

ROHDE: Appointed by Trump and met me just, again -- I just -- this is, again, a huge moment in American history. Dozens of judges, including Trump-appointed judges, rejected his claims in 2020 that the election had been stolen. The judiciary upheld the 2020 election. The judiciary was the strongest branch, almost, in defending democracy. 

So, Judge Cannon, you know, I want to be fair to her. Maybe she can, you know, rule in an unbiased way but she made several rulings overturned very quickly by her superiors in federal appellate court that were seen as unusual. 

Andrew can speak about this more. So, she has a moment, you know, a chance here in American history to oversee a fair trial and I hope she does that. 

ANA CABRERA: Andrew, my understanding is judges like this would be selected randomly, so it just happened to end up back in her lap, but given her history in the case, would this be a situation in which because of public perception of, you know, whatever, they would choose to intentionally shift this away from her court? 

ANDREW WEISSMANN: So I think there's still some unanswered questions. One, was this a complete random selection. The idea that out of, you know, a dozen or so judges it just happened to then go to the same judge and magistrate judge could happen mathematically, but seems unlikely. 

The other was whether somehow it got related to her because she had this civil case before, but usually criminal cases and civil cases don't relate to each other. So that could happen. And then it's possible that it was just random. 

To your point, whether she stays on the case or whether she either recuses herself voluntarily or is asked to recuse herself because of her prior service on the case, I think still remains to be seen and I think David was very polite in describing her rulings. 

I was-- and others were very critical of her decisions. You have to remember it is unusual to be reversed in the way that she was, but she was reversed not once, but twice by an extremely conservative appellate court and the decisions were, to put it bluntly, scathing. I mean, she really got the law completely wrong and that's not me saying that, that is the Court of Appeals. So, the idea that she's back on the case, it would certainly be a very large challenge to see her rise to the occasion.

I always thought after the first reversal she might rise to the occasion but that didn't happen and she had to be reversed again, so it will be interesting to see whether she stays on the case, I think that's still an open issue.",279096,,['Alex Christy'],"['New York', 'American']","['ROHDE', 'Trump', 'ANDREW WEISSMANN', 'Andrew', 'Weissmann', 'Diaz', 'Aileen Cannon', 'Andrew Weissmann', 'DAVID ROHDE', 'JOSE DIAZ-BALART', 'Biden', 'DIAZ-BALART', 'Rohde', 'Cannon', 'David Rohde', 'ANA CABRERA', 'Ana Cabrera', 'Diaz-Balart', 'David']","['NBC', 'MSNBC', 'federal appellate court', 'Mueller', 'the\xa0Court of Appeals', 'Subway']","['MSNBC', 'Trump Judge', 'a Fair Trial', 'the days', 'a judge', 'a Trump indictment case', 'the cast', ""MSNBC's Friday special coverage"", 'the matter', 'the alarm', 'Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon', 'some', 'her previous rulings', 'Diaz-Balart', 'the news', 'national security', 'his thoughts', 'NBC', 'Judge\xa0Aileen Cannon', 'this case', '\xa0Just thought, your reaction', 'that', 'the news', 'Rohde', 'I', 'she', 'you', 'it', 'the trial', 'she', 'some very unusual rulings', 'the course', 'the litigation', 'the search warrant', 'Rohde', 'Cannon’s decision', 'a special master', 'September', 'Diaz-Balart', 'Cannon', 'Trump', 'Rohde', 'you', 'I', 'her', 'she', 'you', 'an\xa0unbiased way', 'she', 'several rulings', 'her superiors', 'federal appellate court', 'that', 'his remarks', 'Rohde', 'an anti-Trump knee-jerk reflex', 'it', 'what', 'a fair trial', 'She', 'a moment', 'you', 'a chance', 'American history', 'a\xa0fair trial', 'I', 'she', 'that', 'Diaz-Balart', 'Ana Cabrera', 'she', 'former top Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann', 'my understanding', 'judges', 'this', 'it', 'her lap', 'her\xa0history', 'the case', 'this', 'a situation', 'which', 'public perception', 'you', 'whatever', 'they', 'this', 'her court', 'That', 'a question', 'that', 'the media', 'the New York case', 'the judge', 'a daughter', 'that', 'the Biden campaign', 'it', 'Cannon', 'the case', 'her previous involvement', 'it', 'Weissmann', 'the idea', 'she', 'herself', 'her\xa0prior service', 'the case', 'Rohde’s assessment', 'Weissmann', 'his criticisms', 'Cannon', 'that', 'a partisan activist', 'she', 'an extremely conservative\xa0appellate court', 'the decisions', 'it', 'I', 'she', 'the law', 'that', 'me', 'that', 'that', 'the\xa0Court', 'Appeals', 'He', 'Cannon', 'the challenge', 'she', 'the case', 'it', 'a very large challenge', 'her', 'the occasion', 'I', 'the first\xa0reversal', 'she', 'the\xa0occasion', 'that', 'she', 'it', 'she', 'the case', 'I', 'that', 'an open\xa0issue', 'Cannon', 'an unprecedented and politically sensitive case', 'a former president', 'who', 'she', 'a ruling', 'it', 'that', 'definitive proof', 'partiality', 'This segment', 'Subway', 'a transcript', 'the June 9 show', '\n\n\nMSNBC\xa0The Indictment', 'Donald Trump', 'JOSE DIAZ-BALART', 'NBC', 'Judge\xa0Aileen Cannon', 'this case', '\xa0Just thought, your reaction', 'that', '\xa0\n\nDAVID ROHDE', 'I', 'she', 'you', 'it', 'the trial', 'she', 'some very unusual rulings', 'the course', 'the litigation', 'the search warrant', '\xa0\n\nDIAZ-BALART', 'Trump', '\xa0\n\nROHDE', 'Trump', 'me', 'this', 'a huge moment', 'American history', 'Dozens', 'judges', 'Trump-appointed judges', 'his claims', 'the\xa0election', 'The judiciary', 'the 2020\xa0election', 'The judiciary', 'the strongest\xa0branch', 'democracy', 'you', 'I', 'her', 'she', 'you', 'an\xa0unbiased way', 'she', 'several rulings', 'her superiors', 'federal appellate court', 'that', 'Andrew', 'this', 'she', 'a moment', 'you', 'a chance', 'American history', 'a\xa0fair trial', 'I', 'she', 'that', '\xa0\n\nANA CABRERA', 'my understanding', 'judges', 'this', 'it', 'her lap', 'her\xa0history', 'the case', 'this', 'a situation', 'which', 'public perception', 'you', 'whatever', 'they', 'this', 'her court', 'ANDREW WEISSMANN', 'I', 'some\xa0unanswered questions', 'this', 'a complete random\xa0selection', 'The idea', 'you', 'a dozen or\xa0so judges', 'it', 'the same judge', '\xa0magistrate judge', 'it', 'her', 'she', 'this civil case', 'criminal cases', 'civil\xa0cases', 'that', 'it', 'it', 'your point', 'she', 'the case', 'she', 'herself', 'herself', 'her\xa0prior service', 'the case', 'I', 'I', 'David', 'her rulings', 'I', 'others', 'her decisions', 'You', 'it', 'the\xa0way', 'that', 'she', 'she', 'an extremely conservative\xa0appellate court', 'the decisions', 'it', 'I', 'she', 'the law', 'that', 'me', 'that', 'that', 'the\xa0Court', 'Appeals', 'she', 'the case', 'it', 'a very large challenge', 'her', 'the occasion', 'I', 'the first\xa0reversal', 'she', 'the\xa0occasion', 'that', 'she', 'it', 'she', 'the case', 'I', 'that', 'an open\xa0issue', 'None']"

Dickerson also reveled in how Trump was “being charged with something that...Hillary Clinton, was — was accused of doing” and led to his 2016 victory. Co-host Tony Dokoupil also went aboard the wayback machine, reading an 2016 quote of Trump ironically promising to “enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information” and “[n]o one will be above the law.”

 





 

Dickerson then huffed the GOP “is largely rallying behind him” even though “we don’t know the facts of the case yet” and thus not only are speaking too soon, but not being proper “stewards of our system” of government.

“[W]e all have to be careful because we don’t know what the facts are. And yet, a lot of people including the House speaker are rushing in and saying this is a politicalization, that it’s a weaponization. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said that. We don’t know,” he added.

After discussing with the CBS Mornings co-hosts what this means for both the GOP primary and general election, co-host and Democratic donor Gayle King lamented “[i]t’s interesting how some people say he should not be President again, but when pushed would you support him if he’s a nominee, in some cases they said yes, I would still support him” (instead of, as would be implied, Biden).

She added such a belief is “confusing...for voters.”

Dickerson went right along: “It’s confusing. It’s also a little tricky because the rules of the Republican debate are that you have to say you’re going to support the nominee, so there might be cutesiness that they’re — that those other Republican candidates are playing, but it is one of the intent — internal tensions here”.

[ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: Breaking Overnight; Trump Indicted in Classified Docs Case]

JOHN DICKERSON: But also this is a President who’s being charged with something that his former opponent in 2016, Hillary Clinton, was — was accused of doing, and he beat her because of it.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.

DICKERSON: I mean, when you think of the historical parallels, that’s also something that adds to the complexity and richness of this moment.

DOKOUPIL: There’s a Donald Trump quote for every occasion, of course. And since you mentioned 2016, back then the tune that he was singing is “I’m going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.” We’re in a different place now.

DICKERSON: We are in a different place. His party is — is largely rallying around him. And — and we don’t know the facts of the case yet. This is another one of those instances where we are all stewards of our system, and we all have to be careful because we don’t know what the facts are. And yet, a lot of people including the House speaker are rushing in and saying this is a politicalization, that it’s a weaponization. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said that. We don’t know. And you know, it’s not only the retention of records and the possible dissemination of information that’s the most highly sensitive, but it’s also obstruction of justice. When you receive a subpoena, you can’t lie about whether you’ve answered the subpoena. You’re not supposed to — in — in the system, and one of the bedrock principles is that everybody is treated the same. So, the lieutenant colonel who’s gone to jail for three years because of records he kept is — kept — is — is treated the same way as a former president in the American system. That’s one of the things at issue here.

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So John, you mentioned some of the Republican candidates for the presidency who are all talking about the weaponization of the Department of Justice. But there are two, Chris Christie, Asa Hutchinson, who have called this for what many believe it to be. Chris Christie says no one is above the law. Will that work with primary voters, with independent voters who are maybe — you said something interesting, the fact that every time President Trump faces a situation like this he says it’s a hoax? It loses all meaning.

GAYLE KING: Witch hunt.

DUTHIERS: Witch hunt. Are independent voters tired of that and are maybe looking for something different?

DICKERSON: We don’t know yet. One of the things that was interesting about the Hillary Clinton case in 2016 is when issues were raised about her e-mails, one of the things that analysts said is, you know, it reminded voters that — that if Hillary Clinton gets elected there will just be a lot of mishegas of her presidency. You could easily see that being the case with Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis and others who have essentially raised that point. Basically we don’t want a lot of drama, so that could be something that’s a part of this. What’s interesting is the continuum of candidates. So, as you mentioned, Asa Hutchinson said this is proof that Donald Trump should not run. Mike Pence said this is divisive, but before this information came out, he said Donald Trump shouldn’t be President again because of what he did on January 6th. 

DOKOUPIL: Yep. 

DICKERSON: This information comes out in a different context. You have a bunch of people in the Republican Party whoa re saying he should not be president again, and this trial will go on well into the primary, well, maybe into the general election. And so it will be a constant source of conversation as people discuss issues like character, what does it mean to, you know, obey the law and — and that changes this from the previous trouble that Donald Trump has been in.

KING: It’s interesting how some people say he should not be President again, but when pushed would you support him if he’s a nominee, in some cases they said yes, I would still support him. That’s confusing, I think, for voters.

DICKERSON: It’s confusing. It’s also a little tricky because the rules of the Republican debate are that you have to say you’re going to support the nominee, so there might be cutesiness that they’re — 

DOKOUPIL: Yeah.

DICKERSON: — that those other Republican candidates are playing, but it is one of the intent — internal tensions here — 

KING: Yeah.

DICKERSON: — is that on the one hand these other candidates are trying to court Donald Trump’s voters by saying they support him, but they’re doing so in order, hopefully, to beat him.

KING: Alright, John Dickerson.

1606,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Stephanopoulos Feigns Outrage When (Now Former) Trump Lawyer Brings Up Biden Docs,"June 9th, 2023 12:53 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2023/06/09/stephanopoulos-feigns-outrage-when-now-former-trump-lawyer-brings,"Hours before he suddenly resigned as one of former President Trump’s attorneys in the classified documents case (which Trump said Thursday he was being indicted in), Jim Trusty made the rounds on TV Friday morning to defend Trump and, on ABC’s Good Morning America, left co-host and former Clinton official George Stephanopoulos in a hilarious pit of rage for bringing up the Biden classified documents probe.

Stephanopoulos clearly had no clue that’s what Trusty would invoke when he questioned whether he and Trump “believe...no person is above the law.”

 





 

Trusty said the real answer was “[n]o one is below the law” before dropping the nuke on Stephanopoulos’s head:


[Y]ou’ve got these investigations in Delaware that are 1,000 times more serious by a sitting President who has authorized his DOJ to try to sink the candidacy of his prime opposition while that guy has unsecured documents that he stole out of a SCIF dozens of years ago. Look, we’re not talking about some sort of favoritism.


The small man at ABC was enraged: “What are you talking about, sir? What are you talking about? That is a ridiculous statement.”

Since Stephanopoulos was, in fact, a liberal operative and not completely ignorant, it’d be a safe bet to wager he knew exactly what Trusty had said.

Trusty snuffed this out: “Oh, there’s this issue — nice try. There’s an issue that anyone that reads any newspapers would agree is a parallel track which is the Delaware document scandal of Joe Biden where there’s a special counsel, Rob Hur, that’s investigating it.”

For the benefit of viewers and to further embarrass Stephanopoulos, Trusty summarized the Biden documents scandal:


You know that there were documents that were sensitive that were marked classified found in a garage near a Corvette that made their way through Chinatown, through the Penn Biden center. There’s 1,850 boxes that have never been fully looked at University of Delaware. You have the ultimate unclean hands of a current sitting President who had no declassification, had none of the protections of President Trump and who literally had to have stolen stuff from a SCIF. Even Dick Durbin commented this was an outrageous possession of classified material by Vice President, at that point, Joe Biden.


Trust wrapped by telling Stephanopoulos he could “scoff and act like there’s nothing to it, but the whole country knows the basic notion of unequal treatment and fairness and that’s what’s at issue with this prosecution.” And that’s without mentioning Hillary Clinton.

Stephanopoulos was still mad, bidding him farewell with this swipe: “I don’t think you have any of the evidence to back up any of the charges you just made.”

Earlier in the show, Stephanopoulos offered a mini-lecture full of piousness: “The idea that no person is above the law is a bedrock principle of American justice. And it's being tested never before now that Donald Trump is the first former president in American history to face criminal charges from the federal government.” 

Oh, like his bosses the Clintons cared about that!?

He cited this as “the latest in a litany of firsts for” any president with Trump being impeached twice, found liable in a civil case, “indicted in state court,” and had “[h]is company convicted of tax fraud” with “more...indictments” possible.

“Another first? That former president, defeated for reelection once is, for now, at least the front runner for his party's nomination,” he concluded before tossing to a series of correspondents on the case.

[ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: New This Morning; Trump Indicted by Special Counsel; Sources: Former President Faces at Least Seven Charges Related to Secret Documents]

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: The idea that no person is above the law is a bedrock principle of American justice. And it's being tested never before now that Donald Trump is the first former president in American history to face criminal charges from the federal government. It’s in the latest in a litany of firsts for a former President; Impeached not once, but twice. Last month, found liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial, indicted in state court for paying hush money to a porn star. His company convicted of tax fraud. And Trump still faces two more possible indictments for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Another first? That former president, defeated for reelection once is, for now, at least the front runner for his party's nomination. Our team is covering all the angles of this astonishing legal and political story.

STEPHANOPOULOS: But doesn’t the President, don’t you believe in the principle that no person is above the law? If the President committed the same crime that someone else did, shouldn’t he be charged?

JIM TRUSTY: No person is below the law. That’s really the issue here. I mean, you’ve got these investigations in Delaware that are 1,000 times more serious by a sitting President who has authorized his DOJ to try to sink the candidacy of his prime opposition while that guy has unsecured documents that he stole out of a SCIF dozens of years ago. Look, we’re not talking about some sort of favoritism.

STEPHANOPOULOS: What are you talking about, sir? What are you talking about? That is a ridiculous statement.

TRUSTY: Oh, there’s this issue — nice try. There’s an issue that anyone that reads any newspapers would agree is a parallel track which is the Delaware document scandal of Joe Biden where there’s a special counsel, Rob Hur, that’s investigating it. You know that there were documents that were sensitive that were marked classified found in a garage near a Corvette that made their way through Chinatown, through the Penn Biden center.

You can scoff and act like there’s nothing to it, but the whole country knows the basic notion of unequal treatment and fairness and that’s what’s at issue with this prosecution.

1607,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",CNN Whines About Companies Not Following Radical ESG Goals,"June 9th, 2023 12:51 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/nicholas-schau/2023/06/09/cnn-whines-about-companies-not-following-radical-esg-goals,"CNN genuflected to leftists’ climate change radicalism by whining about companies around the world doing “almost nothing'' to adhere to nutty environmental, social and governance standards.

Relying on a study by ESG Book, a woke advocacy organization, CNN peddled the radical ESG nonsense by mourning that “just 22% of the world’s 500 biggest public companies by market value are aligned with the Paris Agreement.” Further, as CNN's ludicrous argument went, companies are supposedly on track to reach “a disastrous level of warming that could expose billions of people to dangerously hot conditions.” It’s like CNN was prophesying the coming of climate Armageddon.

CNN harrumphed that “the world is way off track to reach its climate goals.” It also saw companies like Shell and BP as “major polluters” and sobbed that those companies were shifting focus to fossil fuels when they are profitable, er, like any other company that cares about profits.

CNN’s source, ESG book, which is as activist as the name implies, “assigned ‘temperature scores’ to companies” in a plot to pressure them into conforming to the crazy climate agenda. CNN quoted ESG Book CEO Daniel Klier, who complained that companies are “‘not necessarily all moving at the right pace.’” 

In addition, CNN promoted ESG Book’s reported call for “more stringent government policies'' and “changes to consumer behavior.” Sounds like a pretty Orwellian scheme to get the agenda that the climate alarmists want. But CNN, true to its leftist bona fides, propped up the scheme as necessary to constitute a “meaningful shift in the current climate trajectory.”

 





 

CNN also cited the ESG-friendly International Energy Agency to protest the fact that “slightly more than $1 trillion is expected to flow toward oil” and other natural resources this year. This funding, whined the propagandists at CNN and the IEA, “is significantly above the level consistent with the world reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.”

In contrast with what radical climate activists like CNN have been saying, Hoover Institution Visiting Fellow Bjorn Lomborg pointed out in an interview with The Spectator that “when you’re inundated with all of this [climate] information that tells you the end is nigh, it sort of makes you believe, ‘Well, we should spend whatever on it’…. ‘If this is going to kill everyone on earth, obviously this is our biggest and only thing we should be concerned about.’ It is not.”

Lomborg said that while climate change is “certainly something you’d prefer not to have,” it is “also something that you can live with, and you should live with….” He also spoke against the “enormous amount of [climate] policies that are very costly and that actually do very little good.”

Independent investigative journalist Lee Fang reported that senior officials of Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) went into panic mode when people bagan probing the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) efforts to target some political content on social media. The officials “intervened to slow the release of public records that might have shed more light on the nature of the federal government’s anti-misinformation crusade,” Fang wrote, after he filed a records request.

Fang and journalists from a couple of outlets had separately filed public records requests with the University of Washington’s (UW) government-funded think tank run by UW Associate Professor Kate Starbird, he wrote. Starbird was also on the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency’s (CISA) “Misinformation, Disinformation and Malinformation” advisory subcommittee, one of the last remnants of Biden’s defunct, tyrannical Disinformation Governance Board. Fang has reportedly since obtained documents on the matter, despite the DOJ trying to delay the records release. The DOJ even pondered legal action to block documents’ release.

Western District of Washington Assistant U.S. Attorney Annalisa Cravens emailed Starbird about the records requests that the university had been receiving, according to a screenshot of an email Fang included in his report. “Could we please see a copy of any relevant CISA documents that you may plan to produce?” Cravens asked in the email. “[W]e would also ask to have an extension of time before the records are produced so that we can have time to review them and assess whether we’ll have to file suit to protect them from disclosure.”

Fang noted that it is unclear exactly which documents were withheld as a result ofgovernment interference. He said he received multiple notifications from UW seeking deadline extensions for complying with his request. The documents he sought were finally released after March congressional hearings on the same subject.

The DOJ can block information releases if such releases could undermine national security, Fang noted. He added, however, that this exception has been abused a number of times. Starbird has also made “exaggerated claims of harassment to dismiss journalistic interest.” 

Biden’s DHS clearly isn’t too thrilled about its dirty laundry potentially being aired out.

Brinkley and host Sara Sidner also acted as if nothing has happened between Watergate and present day when wondering why Republicans do not urge Trump to step aside like they did with Richard Nixon.

Sidner claimed that Watergate represents the best comparison to Trump’s current situation, “but there is a key difference which you just mentioned now, which is that back then Republicans turned on their president because of the enormity of all of the evidence that was coming out about Nixon. That is not happening today. What's the difference? Why?”

 





 

That CNN could ask that question in a history segment without going through the history of Clinton family, whether it be Bill’s impeachment for perjuring himself or obstructing justice or Hillary’s e-mail server, and the lack of criminal charges and of Democrats urging them to step aside is remarkable.

As it was, Brinkley lamented “We just don't have moderate Republicans like Howard Baker of Tennessee or conservatives like Barry Goldwater of Arizona.”

After claiming Trump “has been able to hijack the Republican,” Brinkley turned to Ford:


It's a big debate in history, was Gerald Ford right to pardon Nixon? I've always thought Ford was right to heal the country, pardoning Nixon but in recent years I realized it was probably a mistake for the reason that it encourages the arrogance of President Trump. This feeling that he's above the law, that the Constitution doesn't matter. That you can have an authoritarian bent and do anything you want in the United States. 


Circling back to today’s Republicans, Brinkley worried that they will use the situation to be critical of President Biden:

So, I find it encouraging that the Justice Department with all the noise going on now is focusing on this and telling Donald Trump he's not above the law and it's going to be a spring/summer of indictments, but we are in a strange political atmosphere right now because some Republicans will claim that Joe Biden, the president, is trying to put his chief GOP rival in jail.

That is not nearly as “strange” as CNN pretending the history of presidential criminal scandals stopped in 1974 and resumed with Trump.

SARA SIDNER: I do want to speak to the history of all of this and the most notable case that a lot of people cite when they look at what’s happening now and what has happened in the past is the case of President Richard Nixon and Watergate, but there is a key difference which you just mentioned now, which is that back then Republicans turned on their president because of the enormity of all of the evidence that was coming out about Nixon. That is not happening today. What's the difference? Why? 

DOUGLAS BRINKLEY: At least not at this moment. I was encouraged, Sara, by your comment that Mitch McConnell and some in the Senate are kind of holding back on fire. We just don't have moderate Republicans like Howard Baker of Tennessee or conservatives like Barry Goldwater of Arizona. 

Back then, the fact that Nixon broke the law was enough to make them realize that wasn't the Republican Party. Donald Trump has been able to hijack the Republican Party and, you know, it's a big debate in history, was Gerald Ford right to pardon Nixon? I've always thought Ford was right to heal the country, pardoning Nixon but in recent years I realized it was probably a mistake for the reason that it encourages the arrogance of President Trump. This feeling that he's above the law, that the Constitution doesn't matter. That you can have an authoritarian bent and do anything you want in the United States. 

So, I find it encouraging that the Justice Department with all the noise going on now is focusing on this and telling Donald Trump he's not above the law and it's going to be a spring/summer of indictments, but we are in a strange political atmosphere right now because some Republicans will claim that Joe Biden, the president, is trying to put his chief GOP rival in jail.",279090,,['Alex Christy'],"['Arizona', 'the United\xa0States', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'Tennessee', 'Republican']","['Trump', 'Sara Sidner', 'SARA SIDNER', 'Sara', 'Ford', 'Biden', 'Douglas Brinkley', 'Hillary', 'Howard Baker', 'Sidner', 'Gerald Ford', 'Clinton', 'Bill', 'DOUGLAS BRINKLEY', 'Nixon', 'Richard Nixon', 'Joe Biden', 'Brinkley', 'Mitch McConnell', 'Barry Goldwater', 'Donald Trump']","['the\xa0Republican Party', 'the Republican Party', 'CNN', 'the Justice Department', 'CNN News Central', 'GOP', 'Subway', 'Senate']","['Brinkley', 'Gerald Ford', ""Trump's Indictment"", ""'Authoritarian Bent"", 'Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley', 'Friday’s CNN News Central', 'former President Trump’s latest indictment', 'it', 'a curious suspect', 'Gerald Ford', 'Brinkley', 'host Sara Sidner', 'nothing', 'Watergate', 'present day', 'Republicans', 'Trump', 'they', 'Richard Nixon', '\n\nSidner', 'Watergate', 'the best comparison', 'Trump’s current situation', 'a key difference', 'which', 'you', 'which', 'Republicans', 'their\xa0president', 'the\xa0enormity', 'all', 'the evidence', 'that', 'Nixon', 'That', 'What', 'the difference', 'CNN', 'that question', 'a history segment', 'the history', 'Clinton family', 'it', 'Bill’s impeachment', 'himself', 'justice', 'Hillary’s e-mail server', 'the lack', 'criminal charges', 'Democrats', 'them', 'it', 'Brinkley', 'We', 'moderate\xa0Republicans', 'Howard Baker', 'Tennessee', 'conservatives', 'Barry Goldwater', 'Arizona', 'Trump', 'the Republican', 'Brinkley', 'Ford', 'It', 'a big debate', 'history', 'Gerald Ford', 'Nixon', 'I', 'Ford', 'the country', 'Nixon', 'recent\xa0years', 'I', 'it', 'a mistake', 'the reason', 'it', 'the arrogance', 'President Trump', '\xa0This feeling', 'he', 'the\xa0law', 'the Constitution', 'you', 'an\xa0authoritarian bent', 'anything', 'you', 'the United\xa0States', 'today’s Republicans', 'Brinkley', 'they', 'the situation', 'President Biden', 'I', 'it', 'the Justice Department', 'the noise', 'this', 'Donald Trump', 'he', 'the\xa0law', 'it', 'a\xa0spring/summer', 'indictments', 'we', 'a strange\xa0political atmosphere', 'some Republicans', 'Joe Biden', 'the\xa0president', 'his\xa0chief GOP rival', 'jail', 'That', 'CNN', 'the history', 'presidential criminal scandals', 'Trump', 'This segment', 'Subway', 'a transcript', 'the June 9 show', '\n\n\nCNN News Central', 'SARA SIDNER', 'I', 'the\xa0history', 'all', 'this', 'the\xa0most notable case', 'that', 'a lot', 'people', 'they', 'what', 'what', 'the past', 'the case', 'President Richard Nixon', '\xa0Watergate', 'a key difference', 'which', 'you', 'which', 'Republicans', 'their\xa0president', 'the\xa0enormity', 'all', 'the evidence', 'that', 'Nixon', 'That', 'What', 'the difference', '\xa0\n\nDOUGLAS BRINKLEY', 'this moment', 'I', 'your\xa0comment', 'Mitch McConnell', 'some', 'the Senate', 'fire', 'We', 'moderate\xa0Republicans', 'Howard Baker', 'Tennessee', 'conservatives', 'Barry Goldwater', 'Arizona', 'the fact', 'Nixon', 'the law', 'them', 'that', 'the\xa0Republican Party', 'Donald Trump', 'the Republican Party', 'you', 'it', 'a big debate', 'history', 'Gerald Ford', 'Nixon', 'I', 'Ford', 'the country', 'Nixon', 'recent\xa0years', 'I', 'it', 'a mistake', 'the reason', 'it', 'the arrogance', 'President Trump', '\xa0This feeling', 'he', 'law', 'the Constitution', 'you', 'an\xa0authoritarian bent', 'anything', 'you', 'the United\xa0States', 'I', 'it', 'the Justice Department', 'the noise', 'this', 'Donald Trump', 'he', 'the\xa0law', 'it', 'a\xa0spring/summer', 'indictments', 'we', 'a strange\xa0political atmosphere', 'some Republicans', 'Joe Biden', 'the\xa0president', 'his\xa0chief GOP rival', 'jail', 'None']"
1610,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Joe Scarbough Fakes Sorrow for 'Extremely Sad' 'Bleak Day' of Trump Indictment,"June 9th, 2023 11:30 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/mark-finkelstein/2023/06/09/joe-scarbough-fakes-sorrow-extremely-sad-bleak-day-trump,"On Friday's Morning Joe, they were wallowing in more proof of their constant foresight that the ""walls are closing in on Trump."" Joe Scarborough cried crocodile tears, breaking out a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger shtick. Scarborough proclaimed this to be a ""bleak, dark day for America,"" and ""something I feared for a long time."" Riiight.

Scarborough was clearly aware that many wouldn't buy his crocodile tears, and he thus insisted that: ""if anybody thinks I'm being glib or or not completely straightforward in saying that, they don't understand."" Sure.

Scarborough quickly enough recovered from his sadness, and proceeded to speculate with Chuck Rosenberg, a former US Attorney and aide to FBI Director James Comey, about the long prison term Trump could be facing. Scarborough even imagined Trump spending ""the rest of his life in jail."" That prospect surely helped dry Joe's tears.

Rosenberg said that if were facing federal civil charges, it would keep him up at night. But if facing federal criminal charges, he'd be a ""basket case.""





 

Then it was George Conway's turn to weigh in. He dissented from Scarborough's assertion that the indictment marks a ""sad"" day. To the contrary, claimed Conway, ""the sad point was that we had a president who was such a brazen criminal."" He doubled down a few sentences later: ""And we have a Republican party where virtually all of its major figures are so spineless that they can't simply say, we don't support this criminal. ""

Apparently chastened by Conway's dissent, and desperate to salvage some liberal street cred, Scarborough replied by saying he actually agreed with Conway! The Republicans are horrible people. It's a ""grim way"" because ""40, 42, 43% of Americans now know this guy likely violated the Espionage Act and they don't give a damn! So at the end of the day, Donald Trump's right. He could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn't care. Because what he's done is, most likely, he's violated the Espionage Act.""

At the end of the day, Scarborough will compare taking some classified documents to shooting someone on the street. But yeah, he's ""extremely sad"" at this bad news for Trump.

Joe Scarborough crying crocodile tears over the indictment of Donald Trump on federal criminal charges relating to his handling of classified documents was sponsored in part by GlaxoSmithKline, maker of the meningitis B vaccine, Chase, Visa, Servpro, Etsy, and Dove. 

Here's the transcript.

Morning Joe

6:07 am EDT

JOE SCARBOROUGH: I will say, this is, this is, this is a dark day for America. And if anybody thinks I'm, I'm being glib or, or, or not completely straightforward in saying that, they don't understand. This is something I feared for a longtime.

I remember having the discussion when people were talking about indicting George W. Bush because of supposed war crimes. I said, okay, that's great. What are you going to do four years from now or eight years ago when Republicans try to indict Barack Obama for war crimes, for the drone warfare, for whatever?

But here we are, and I'm sure you agree with me. It is a bleak, dark day for America, but also a day that we, we knew had to come. I mean, Donald Trump, I think perhaps one of the most dangerous political and constitutional norms he's broken through is this one, that a former president is actually indicted by the Justice Department.

. . . 

One of these charges, I read this morning, could carry with it a possible eight-year term. Donald Trump may be typing in all caps right now. But he  understands the gravity of federal charges against him. He also understands he could spend a significant amount of time in jail if found guilty on all of these charges. Which may actually make him a bit more flip moving forward in these deliberations. Because he could spend the rest of his life in jail if charged on all of these counts.

CHUCK ROSENBERG: To your point, Joe, you can go to jail and you can go to jail for a very long time. So I don't want to get ahead of this. He's only been charged at this point, not even arraigned, certainly hasn't been tried, and hasn't been convicted or sentenced.

But the reason this is so serious and the reason it is so different, is that if you lose in court as a defendant in a federal criminal case, you can go to jail. And so, civil cases are serious. And if it was me on the short end of one of those, it would keep me up at night. If I was on the short end of a federal criminal trial, I would be a basket case.

. . . 

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Attorney George Conway is joining the conversation. George, let's bring you in and get your reaction to this historic moment, and your assessment of these charges, now being brought forth in Florida.

GEORGE CONWAY: Well, I wanted to dissent a little bit from some of what was said earlier. At least partly. 

I don't think it's a sad day for the country. I think it's a solemn day. I think it's a momentous day, and I think it's an important day and significant day and a very serious day. 

But the sad moments, the sad point was that we had a president who was such a brazen criminal, who launched and inspired an insurrection. Who stole government documents, classified documents, and then tried to conceal them and tried to obstruct justice. And that we have millions of Americans who still want to put him back in the White House. And we have a Republican party where virtually all of its major figures are so spineless that they can't simply say, we don't support this criminal. 

And I, that's -- the sad thing would have been, the terrible thing would have been, the worst thing that could have happened to our republic would have been, if this man was never charged and he was let go.

. . . 

SCARBOROUGH: And I do want to say, I do want to add to what George said, this is an extremely sad day for the, the reasons that I mentioned. 

But I want to add what George said. You have a guy that's been charged with violating the espionage Act, the Espionage Act. He knows that he took classified documents he wasn't supposed to take. They know. They know he took those classified documents as well. They know, all of these people defending him, know that this guy violated the Espionage Act and he lied about it. They know he lied about it to the FBI. They know he lied about it to the DoJ. They know he lied about it to the National Archives. They know he's been lying to them nonstop. They know! And they don't care.  

So while we're adding up all the things that make this a grim day, let's put that near the top of the list. And also that 40, 42, 43% of Americans now know this guy likely violated the Espionage Act and they don't give a damn! 

So at the end of the day, Donald Trump's right. He could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn't care. Because what he's done is, most likely, he's violated the Espionage Act.",279084,,['Mark Finkelstein'],"['Florida', 'US', 'Americans', 'Republicans', 'America', 'Republican']","['James Comey', 'GEORGE CONWAY', 'Trump', 'Joe Scarborough', 'Joe Scarbough', 'Conway', 'SCARBOROUGH', 'JONATHAN LEMIRE', 'Barack Obama', 'Scarborough', ""George Conway's"", 'George Conway', 'Rosenberg', 'JOE SCARBOROUGH', 'CHUCK ROSENBERG', 'George', 'Chuck Rosenberg', 'George W.

1611,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",US Air Force Tweets Photo of Soldier Saluting LGBTQ Flag,"June 9th, 2023 10:56 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/tierin-rose-mandelburg/2023/06/09/us-air-force-tweets-photo-soldier-saluting-lgbtq,"Pride month began just over a week ago, and already this year’s proven to be even more gay than last year...if you can believe it. Most recently, our military posted a graphic of a soldier saluting against not the American Flag but instead, the ""Pride"" flag. 

The image was shared to the official United States Air Force Twitter account on Wednesday under a caption stating, “June is Pride Month! The Department of the Air Force proudly recognizes and celebrates generations of LGBTQI+ service members and their contributions to our Air Force & Space Force.”

The tweet was accompanied by a graphic of a ""Pride"" rainbow - complete with pink and blue stripes representing transgenders - behind the Air Force logo, along with a saluting soldier and the words, “Celebrate PRIDE MONTH.”

— U.S. Air Force (@usairforce) June 7, 2023

The original tweet received almost 5 million views and was also shared by the official Air Force Global Strike Command page which received nearly 50,000 views of its own. Public comments on the tweet have since been shut down.

It really is comical that this administration thinks saluting ""gay pride"" will make our nation look good. If I was a foreign threat and saw a post like this to represent a country’s military, I would be 0% worried about attacking them. 

Others felt similarly on Twitter. The Libs of TikTok account wrote, “What an embarrassment.”

Another user posted, “As a retired Air Force officer I am humiliated by the state of the service. No credible American and no actual Airmen would salute anything but the American flag. Celebrating a military member saluting a pride flag is not just embarrassing it is traitorous. The current senior leadership are no more than a group of Aldrich Ames clones with a few Harvey Milks/Ed Bucks mixed in. Everyone involved in putting this messaging out should have their clearance revoked & face Article 15 procedures. You have all failed in your responsibility and your oath to the US Constitution. Ridiculous and embarrassing.”

ForAmerica President David Bozell added, “You might as well kneel while you’re at it.”

This isn’t the first time, and likely won't be the last, the Department of Defense has shown how willing it is to cave to the woke mob. 

A 2021 U.S. Army recruitment video that looked like it was made by Disney featured a little girl with two moms who found her “calling” to join the U.S. Army. 

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said it best on FNC's The Faulkner Focus: “The job of the military is to kill the bad guys, and it is to -- it is to strike fear in the enemies of America,” not “to sit around a circle emoting and passing daisies back and forth.”

He’s right. Our military needs to focus on what it was designed to do: protect our country, not push a gay agenda that does nothing but set us up for failure.

1612,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Bloomberg Opinion Executive Editor Lectures Faith-Based Investor Over Opposition to ESG,"June 9th, 2023 10:53 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/tom-olohan/2023/06/09/bloomberg-opinion-executive-editor-lectures-faith-based,"Bloomberg Opinion’s Executive Editor could not resist sneering at a faith-based investor over his opposition to woke environmental, social and governance standards during a June 6 podcast. 

Bloomberg Opinion Senior Executive Editor Timothy O'Brien and Bloomberg ESG Reporter Saijel Kishan discussed the case of faith-based investor Robert Netzly on the Crash Course podcast. Bloomberg News’ parent company — Bloomberg L.P. — recently promoted a woke pressure campaign to compel companies to adopt ESG standards.

Neither O’Brien and Kishan disclosed that potential conflict of interest when blasting Netzly. O’Brien condescendingly lectured Netzly — who is involved in promoting a Biblical opposition to woke ESG — on how to be a better Christian.

With all the gross smugness of a Will McAvoy, O’Brien pontificated: “and especially from someone who says they’re a Christian. If you accept that you sort of — a basic tenet of Christianity is love and forgiveness, who is he really forgiving?” He continued his browbeating: “Who does he really love when he’s working through where he is going to invest and then the criticisms he has of other people for making exactly the same choice as he does?” 

If no one else has told O’Brien, Christianity doesn’t come with a prerequisite that mandates people embrace the leftist political agendas that undergird ESG.

O’Brien also could not help interrupting Kishan to smear Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby, accusing faith-based corporations and Netzly of hypocrisy. O’Brien said, “But I also think there’s some hypocrisy and contradictions going on here that are worth exploring. He’s asking companies like Nike, for example, to be neutral and to not put values in front of their product line for example, or to not put values ahead of their sponsorships,” O’Brien added. Daily Wire reporter Spencer Lindquist reported that a leaked email showed that Nike in particular “will host a talk with a child sex-change surgeon to celebrate pride month,” something O’Brien failed to mention while rushing to act like a white knight for Nike.

He continued:  “[Y]et then he’s turning around and saying Chick-fil-A or Hobby Lobby is doing the right thing by restricting certain people from its premises or from its product line and that just feels to me like a deep contradiction,” O’Brien absurdly suggested without showing any evidence that either company had banned LGBT people from entering their stores and buying from them.

O’Brien later chose to misrepresent ESG as its polar opposite, suggesting that ESG prevents discrimination rather than causes it. O’Brien added, “I think there’s definitely a social consensus that people should not be discriminated against for leadership positions in politics or corporate America simply because they are a woman or because they are a person of color or have a different ethnic background.” But financial “discrimination” is exactly what ESG promotes.

Later in the interview, Kishan made the stunning admission that she was surprised to find opposition to ESG in the United States, as if ESG-obsessed asset managers waging a political war against cheap energy, popular food sources and companies that oppose radical gender ideology theory and woke culture wasn’t controversial.

1613,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Hayes Defends ‘Spirited Resistance’ Against Atlanta Training Facility,"June 9th, 2023 10:37 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/ana-schau/2023/06/09/hayes-defends-spirited-resistance-against-atlanta-training-facility,"Chris Hayes took some time in his Wednesday show, All In With Chris Hayes, to describe the “spirited resistance” of the protesters of the new first responder training facility (known to its protesters as “Cop City”) just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, and to condemn the state and city legislators who had authorized its building. Hayes then went on to provide his own opinion on why the training facility was not “the wisest use of Atlanta’s taxpayer dollars,” of course, downplaying the violence from leftist extremists.

The segment began with Hayes’s description of when “a SWAT team descended on a quiet, residential street” and “raided a house” there to arrest three members of the Atlanta Solidarity Fund. This organization was raising money for “a bail fund” to pay for violent activists to be released from prison after being arrested at riots against the facility.

 





 

Hayes played video footage of these arrests, and complained against the harshness of the “SWAT raids for charity fraud” that he said had happened. He ignored the fact that many of the people for whom this organization was funding bail had been participants in violent protests against the police officers and legislators who were responsible for the plan to be approved.

Some of these protesters had even been destroying property and the equipment that was being used for the construction. One activist even shot a police officer who had been standing guard at the prospective facility’s property, before being shot himself in self-defense and killed.

Hayes mournfully noted this “fatal shooting,” but announced that there was “subsequent evidence” to disprove that the activist had shot the officer before he had been shot and killed, despite the officer’s injuries proving otherwise.

Ignoring the impressive work done by lawmakers to plan and fund the facility, Hayes decried the bipartisan support and used the derogatory name for the facility. “In the face of all this opposition, state officials, from Republican Governor Brian Kemp, to Democratic City governance of Atlanta, seem almost monomaniacally fixated on building Cop City,” he whined.

What Hayes omitted was evidence of online coordination between Antifa groups to intimidate and threaten the lives of the city council who voted to approve the new funds.

Then, Hayes showed a graph to indicate the spike in violent crimes in America in 2020, admitting that this might have been due to “the massive disruption of all aspects of social life” that had come with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he then showed a headline of an article that discussed how the rates for violent crime in Atlanta had then gone down around 53 percent by 2023. This, he claimed, reduced the need for a training facility, and rendered it “not clear” whether the facility would be “the wisest use of Atlanta’s taxpayer dollars.”

In addition to all of this, in Hayes’s analysis of the situation, he, like the protesters of the facility, seemed to think that it would only be a police training facility, rather than the actual plans for a complete first responder training facility, including firefighters and EMTs. This facility would facilitate training for all first responders in the area to be able to save more lives every day, including better training of police, which would increase the safety of the area rather than decrease it.

MSNBC All In With Chris Hayes

06/07/23

8:43 PM

CHRIS HAYES: Last week, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, a SWAT team descended on a quiet, residential street in the Edgewood neighborhood of Atlanta. This is what it looked like. A scene, heavily armed members of the Atlanta Police Department, you see them, guns drawn there, as they come out. A joint operation with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, that's a state law enforcement agency, raided a house and arrested three people in it.

Now, if you're looking at that footage, it looked like something you might see for the take-down of a gang leader, or a cartel drug bust. In fact, the people inside that house were organizing legal support and a bail fund for people protesting a very controversial police training facility, that opponents have dubbed, “Cop City.”

The three members of a group called the Atlanta Solidarity Fund were charged with money laundering and charity fraud. You don't see a ton of SWAT raids for charity fraud.

Now, the plan for Cop City was first officially proposed back in 2021, as an 85-acre public safety training campus, complete with a mocks—mock convenience store, home, a nightclub. The building site is a former prison farm, just outside Atlanta, surrounded by a forest.

Initially, officials said taxpayers would pay only about one third of the total 90-million-dollar cost, to the tune of 31 million dollars. Last month, however, they announced the cost to public will more than double, thanks to a provision in the city’s lease with the Atlanta Police Foundation, that will add about another 36 million dollars to the public cost.

The plan set off spirited resistance, it's been going strong for nearly two years now. In fact, protesters moved into the forest to kind of occupy it, in effort to stop construction.

And we've seen violent clashes between those protesters and police, including, most notably, the fatal shooting of the 26-year-old environmental activist in January, who was in the forest. A Georgia State Trooper was also injured in that incident.

Now, at that time, police accused that activist, who went by the nickname “Tortuguita,” of firing on State Troopers without warning. Subsequent evidence makes that appear less likely. In fact, an autopsy commissioned by the activist’s family showed that Tortuguita’s hands were raised when they were shot by troopers.

The crackdown on the resistance to Cop City continued with the arrest of a legal observer and attorney from the Southern Poverty Law Center at a demonstration in March, and he is one of more than 40 people charged with domestic terrorism in connection with the protest, who are accused of participating in what police have called “violent attacks.”

In the face of all this opposition, state officials, from Republican Governor Brian Kemp, to Democratic City governance of Atlanta, seem almost monomaniacally fixated on building Cop City.

And this week, the long fight culminated with a marathon 16-hour meeting of the Atlanta City Council, in a 5:30 A.M. vote, finally approving funding for the facility. More than 300 people stepped up to speak ahead of that vote, the vast majority of them registering their strong opposition to the plan.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: Building a mock city for police officers to practice defense tactics, use militarized equipment, and destroy forest land that’s crucial to combat the effects of climate change is not only harmful, it's anti-black, it’s reinforcing ways to white supremacist tactics, and it's tone-deaf.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The police treatment of Tortuguita and the Atlanta Solidarity Fund and other activists confirms that the Atlanta police should not be rewarded with their own amusement park.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: If you want to protect the people of Atlanta, invest in affordable housing, community food programs, and other emergency financial assistance, not in Cop City.

[Crowd chanting “Cop City will never be built”]  

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HAYES: Now, the context here is important, right, this comes in this broader context of a national conversation about violence in policing over the past few years, right. In 2020, we watched civil rights protests, perhaps the largest in American history, spread across the country after the videotaped police killing of George Floyd. That same year, the rate of violent crime began to spike, with the murder rate jumping up nearly 30 percent.

Now, however, after the plans for Cop City have been initiated, it seems the spike in violence may have had a lot more to do with the massive disruption of all aspects of social life of the pandemic and its aftermath.

Violent crime is rapidly on the decline now. Look at this headline. It's a great, encouraging headline. In Atlanta, the city where this is being done, homicide down more than 50 percent so far this year.

I think it's fair to say that it's just not clear if a 90-million-dollar police training facility is the wisest use of Atlanta's taxpayer dollars, even from a public safety perspective, given that headline.

Despite the overwhelming vote at the city council, opponents of Cop City are not giving up yet. Today, activists announced a plan to force a referendum vote on the project.

And I'll say this: if the people who are so dead set on this project really think it's great on the merits, I would imagine they would welcome a city-wide referendum to make their case, and give it a real mandate, so that Atlantans may actually get a say after all.",279086,,['Ana Schau'],"['Georgia', 'American', 'Atlanta', 'Atlantans', 'Cop City', 'Democratic', 'America', 'Republican',

1614,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","Reid Fears Trump Jury Selection, Smears Florida as 'Beachhead' for 'Nazism'","June 9th, 2023 10:31 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/06/09/reid-fears-trump-jury-selection-smears-florida-beachhead-nazism,"After former President Trump said on Thursday night that he was being indicted, MSNBC’s Joy Reid feared that he would escape conviction because “Florida…has now become a beachhead for…Nazism.”

Addressing failed New York City mayoral candidate Maya Wiley, Reid bashed the entire state:


Florida is not the Florida that people used to think of as just, like, lots of oranges, beaches, and Disney. Florida is now home to one of the largest concentrations of extremist groups in the country. It has now become a beachhead for racial extremism, Nazism, open Nazism, people marching in the streets, even places like South Florida, places like Orlando.


 





 

It must be sad to live your life thinking there’s a Nazi behind every corner, but Reid was just getting started:


The Proud Boys have a huge base in Florida, in Miami-Dade County. They have members or at least affinity people on the Broward School Board. They have essentially taken over the Miami-Dade Republican Party. So, Florida is in many ways a place where the danger to the country, how many Floridians were there on January 6th? A lot. They are a huge source of extremism and pro-Trump extremism specifically.


“Largest concentration” and “huge” are relative terms, a handful of cranks does not constitute a threat to civilization, but just as Wiley was beginning her response, Reid interrupted to add some additional fear-mongering, “It's also a state now where you can carry a firearm without a permit.”

Wiley began by agreeing with that last point, “I mean, look, you're pointing, Joy, to sadly statistics we’ve been seeing rise and we know it increases in election cycles, the violence of hate and extremist groups.”

While she admitted that “many average Floridians do care about the rule of law and do abhor hate and violence,” Wiley also argued it will be up to them to decide:

Do you want democracy and do you want peace, or are you going to go with anyone who, if—if, I'm not saying Donald Trump has or will, in this particular case, but goes to stoking that, exactly what that means for the future of the country, and having been doing work with community-based groups, particularly in Central Florida, I'll say there are a lot of folks who are getting active and engaged because they are concerned about preserving their state's democracy and that does matter. 

As for Reid, she was freaking out over a county that Ron DeSantis won 55-44, which is not nearly as red as Washington, D.C. or New York City is blue.

JOY REID: Well, I mean, it's not going to work, except, Maya, you know, Florida is not the Florida that people used to think of as just, like, lots of oranges, beaches, and Disney. Florida is now home to one of the largest concentrations of extremist groups in the country. It has now become a beachhead for racial extremism, Nazism, open Nazism, people marching in the streets, even places like South Florida, places like Orlando.

It has become a kind of headquarters. The Proud Boys have a huge base in Florida, in Miami-Dade county. They have members or at least affinity people on the Broward School Board. They have essentially taken over the Miami-Dade Republican Party. So, Florida is in many ways a place where the danger to the country, how many Floridians were there on January 6th? A lot. They are a huge source of extremism and pro-Trump extremism specifically.

MAYA WILEY: You know, and sadly – 

REID: And also, I will add one more thing. It's also a state now where you can carry a firearm without a permit. Sorry, go, Maya.

WILEY: Yes, no, I mean, look, you're pointing, Joy, to sadly statistics we’ve been seeing rise and we know it increases in election cycles, the violence of hate and extremist groups, but, you know, I think we also have to remember how many average Floridians do care about the rule of law and do abhor hate and violence. 

And simply put, it's going to be incumbent upon all of those very rational, sane Floridians to recognize, do you want democracy and do you want peace, or are you going to go with anyone who, if—if, I'm not saying Donald Trump has or will, in this particular case, but goes to stoking that, exactly what that means for the future of the country, and having been doing work with community-based groups, particularly in Central Florida, I'll say there are a lot of folks who are getting active and engaged because they are concerned about preserving their state's democracy and that does matter.

Leane Pittsford of Lesbians Who Tech and Allies preceded the pity party by explaining her organization came about after seeing “it was a real struggle to get women, non-binary leaders to participate.”

 





 

In turn, she was determined to “center LGBTQ women and non-binary leaders because frankly, in the queer, gay, LGBTQ+ space, we don’t get centered that often.” Once she started, “it was like lines out the door and people were so excited.”

Co-host Vladimir Duthiers reacted by fretting that “it does feel, though, disheartening,” asking “if it feels this way to you that it feels as if we’re moving backwards often in this country when it comes to issues surrounding LGBTQ.”

Of course, co-host and Democratic donor Gayle King interjected as Duthiers spoke to agree, saying “yeah” and similarly griping about the lack of universal support for the pro-trans support forced on the populace by “Target and Budweiser.”

“Just look at the backlash,” said both Duthiers and King to Pittsford.

Duthiers added another lament that “[t]he things that you thought were already sort of said and done are coming back to the forefront.”

Pittsford obviously agreed that she thought LGBTQ issues would be widely accepted when she “worked on marriage equality — right — and it was really powerful when tech and business showed up for the community.”

But now, she claimed, corporate America must be even more forceful in defending and promoting transgendersim:


And you know, frankly, I want to see corporate America stand up more for trans leaders, right? Like there is so much anti-trans legislation. We definitely have to show up and step up and you know, economic power can really move the needle here and tech, business, they have a lot of power to fight this and you know, a lot of them are but we have more to do.


To close out the segment, co-host Tony Dokoupil invited Pittsford to plug her upcoming conference that she said will have “20,000 people from all over the world” with speakers such as Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) to discuss abortion with the lesbian IT businesswomen.

Huh?

Thursday’s pro-trans bullying and propaganda was made possible thanks to advertisers such as Google and Kia. Follow the links to see their contact information at the MRC’s Conservatives Fight Back page.

[ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: Coming up; “Changing the Game”]

FORTUNE FEIMSTER: Coming up, we’ll talk with a woman who’s changing the game. Leanne Pittsford is in our Progressive greenroom to tell us about our mission to give more women and LGBTQ people involved in the tech world.

(....)

8:45 a.m. Eastern

[ON-SCREEN HEADLINE: Allies in the Tech World; Founder of “Lesbians Who Tech and Allies” on Mission to Help LGBTQ+]

GAYLE KING: This Pride Month, we are celebrating leaders in the LGBTQ+ community. It’s part of our continuing series, we call it “Changing the Game.” It highlights extraordinary women who are making a difference now and for future generations. We have another badass for you. It’s Leanne Pittsford. She is the CEO and founder of Lesbians Who Tech and Allies. Founded back in 2013, the organization helps people in the LGBTQ community succeed in technology. Leanne, welcome to you.

LEANNE PITTSFORD: Thank you so much for having me.

KING: So let’s go back to 2013. Yes.

PITTSFORD: I know.

KING: That was 10 years ago, Miss Pittsford.

PITTSFORD: Yes, yes. Ten years now.

KING: What did you see or maybe didn’t see that made you think, Houston, we have a problem here, and I can do something?

PITTSFORD: Yeah, you know, a couple of things. I started my career in the queer community. I was managing the data for the non-Prop 8 campaign, and working in the Castro of San Francisco, and you know, you walk around every day and there were not as many women. You know, it was very male, it was very White. And you kind of take a pause and think about why is that, right? And for me, you know, managing the data, I really saw gap in economic power. How can we make sure women, people of color, non-binary trans have more power?

KING: I’ve heard you say it’s not really a talent issue. It’s an access issue. What did that mean?

PITTSFORD: Right. Well, there’s — I mean, that’s part — we’re trying to show the tech business community what tech and business actually look like, right? It’s not that we’re not there. It is that we don’t have access to these jobs or you know, we’re not being lifted up in the same way that maybe our White cis male counterparts are.

TONY DOKOUPIL: Lesbians who Tech is a great, great name.

KING: I know. It is not like —

DOKOUPIL: I love it. It is so funny.

PITTSFORD: You’re welcome to come.

DOKOUPIL: It is so memorable. I am welcome to come?

PITTSFORD: Absolutely.

DOKOUPIL: As a White cis-gender male?

PITTSFORD: Absolutely. That’s what we have “allies” in the name.

DOKOUPIL: All right.

PITTSFORD: It’s actually —

VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It is right there in the name.

DOKOUPIL: It is right there.

PITTSFORD: — right there in the name. So you feel part of it.

KING: — yes, so you feel included.

PITTSFORD: Absolutely.

DOKOUPIL: A hundred and ten thousand members. I mean, this is a big organization.

PITTSFORD: Yes, it is big.

DOKOUPIL: And you started it as an experiment?

PITTSFORD: Yes, I mean, so I had been in the queer community and it was a real struggle to get women, non-binary leaders to participate, right? And we spent a lot of work. You know, we go to these events, and it would mostly be like 90 percent male, and I was like, there has to be a reason.

DOKOUPIL: Yes.

PITTSFORD: And so my hypothesis was what if we center LGBTQ women and non-binary leaders because frankly, in the queer, gay, LGBTQ+ space, we don’t get centered that often, right? Men make more money than women. You put two men together versus two women; if you’re a woman of color, if you’re trans, we often get left out just from an economic perspective, right? So it’s really important to center us and when we did, it was like lines out the door and people were so excited.

DUTHIERS: Leann, it does feel, though, disheartening.

PITTSFORD: Yeah.

DUTHIERS: I don’t know if it feels this way to you that it feels as if we’re moving backwards —

KING: Yeah.

DUTHIERS: — often in this country when it comes to issues —

PITTSFORD: Yeah. 

DUTHIERS: — surrounding LGBTQ. Do you feel the same way?

KING: The news with —

PITTSFORD: I mean, I worked on —

KING: — Target and Budweiser.

DUTHIERS: Just look at the backlash.

PITTSFORD: — yeah.

KING: Yeah, the backlash. Yeah.

DUTHIERS: The things that you thought were already sort of said and done —

KING: Yeah.

DUTHIERS: — are coming back to the forefront.

PITTSFORD: Well, you know, as a younge — younger gay — as a younger lesbian, I worked on marriage equality — right — and it was really powerful when tech and business showed up for the community. And you know, frankly, I want to see corporate America stand up more for trans leaders, right? Like there is so much anti-trans legislation. We definitely have to show up and step up and you know, economic power can really move the needle here and tech, business, they have a lot of power to fight this and you know, a lot of them are but we have more to do.

DOKOUPIL: Leanne, we’ve got about 30 seconds before the computer is going to take all the black here.

PITTSFORD: Yes, yes.

DOKOUPIL: You’ve got the Fourth Annual Pride Summit for Lesbians Who Tech coming up — And Allies.

PITTSFORD: Yes.

DOKOUPIL: What can you tell us about it?

PITTSFORD: You know, it’s going to have 20,000 people from all over the world. Kara Swisher Sam Altman, we’re going to talk about generative AI. We’ve got Shani (sp?) —

DOKOUPIL: You have the booking.

PITTSFORD: — yes, no, actually, we’ve got Governor Whitmer talking about policy tack abortion, right? We are a place where we’re trying to solve the world’s biggest problems, right and coming together and find solutions, so it’s free. Anyone can join, LesbiansWhoTech.org. Join us.

DOKOUPIL: That’s awesome. That’s —

PITTSFORD: Yes.

KING: Well, that’s quite a lineup.

DUTHIERS: That’s amazing.

DOKOUPIL: Yes, tell Sam — tell them to come by here.

PITTSFORD: Yes.

DOKOUPIL: Leanne Pittsford, thank you very much. That will do it for us. We will see you tomorrow on CBS Mornings.

KING: CBS Mornings.

DOKOUPIL: Seriously impressive.

KING: Take it easy.

1616,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Column: CNN's Mostly False Take on Biden's Stance on Abortion,"June 9th, 2023 5:46 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/09/column-cnns-mostly-false-take-bidens-stance-abortion,"As CNN looks for a new leader, former CNN host Brian Stelter proposed this as the most important question: “What should an anchor do when a guest says something untrue?”

The public could turn this question around: “What should a politician do when a CNN host says something untrue?” The Stelters of this world cannot imagine anyone CNN would ever say anything false. They arrogantly presume they always defend the “truth.”

 During the June 7 CNN town hall with new presidential candidate Mike Pence, interviewer Dana Bash falsely laid out Biden’s position: “He says that codifying Roe vs. Wade is his position. That means a right to an abortion until the point of viability, not up until birth.”

Pence should have interrupted and called her out. Biden was endorsed in 2020 by Planned Parenthood and other abortion lobbies that understood they were getting a staunch abortion-on-demand president.

It's on paper. This is the Biden-Harris Democrat platform language of 2020: “We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion....Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights.” That plainly lines up the Democrats as against “barriers” – “unequivocally.”

Once in office, the president endorsed the so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act,” which would have repealed all state restrictions on abortion. But when Republicans said it was an “abortion until birth” bill, those pro-Democrat “fact checkers” screamed. PolitiFact claimed it was “Mostly False,” since “H.R. 8296 permits abortion up until delivery, but only if it is deemed necessary to protect the life of the patient.” It’s the old “life of the mother” exception an abortionist can easily embrace.

In a CNN town hall on June 4, CNN host Jake Tapper asked presidential candidate Nikki Haley if she would sign a federal ban on abortion at six weeks. Haley smartly shot back: “I will answer that when you answer -- when you ask Kamala and Biden if they would agree to 37 weeks, 38 weeks, 39 weeks. Then I'll answer your question. No one asked them that. No one asked them how late they're willing to go.”

Tapper accurately replied, “I think Biden and Harris have been pretty clear that they don't support any restrictions.” CNN must have received an angry message from Team Biden. An hour later, Tapper claimed his accurate statement was inaccurate.

 “I'm a big believer in people in the media correcting themselves when they err, and I erred earlier,” Tapper claimed. He explained that Biden told an interviewer last fall that his “basic position” is “to codify Roe v. Wade, which would mean abortion legal until, what, first 20 -- I think it's 20 weeks of pregnancy. So I was wrong about that. And he was asked!”

So who asked Biden about his extreme stand? It was Owen Jensen of the Catholic network EWTN (certainly not CNN) as Biden prepared to board his Marine One helicopter. “Should there be any restrictions on abortion at all?” Biden said “yes.” Jensen said, “What should they be?” Biden snapped, “Roe v. Wade, read it, man! You’ll get educated.”

That’s not a precise answer that should cause a fulsome Tapper apology, but CNN quickly and obediently responds to Democrat complaints. Try to define any Democrat talking about the “restrictions” in their “codifying Roe” legislation. They talk about that precious right to abortion, and that’s it.

The Stelteresque sticklers think politicians must be fact-checked in real time.

But while many of his detractors in the liberal media were doing their happy dance, Chris Cuomo was on his eponymous NewsNation show with independent journalist Matt Taibbi, where both men cast doubt on the charges and had some pretty intense criticisms, including a comparison to a third-world country.

Towards the end of the show, which was entirely dedicated to the Trump Indictment, Cuomo introduced his guest and had some critical words for investigators. He chided that he wasn’t sure if they were “intentionally or unintentionally helping” Trump “because every time there's a swing, it seems to expose the fact they go after him with what seems to be at or below a level of anything that would be impressive to people reviewing the documents.”

Taibbi agreed and reminded viewers that he was “not a fan” of Trump but he had a simple test that any charges directed at a person in Trump’s position needed to pass. Taibbi felt the charges against Trump failed:


But you know, my feeling is if you're going to take the very extreme step of indicting somebody who's the likely nominee of the opposition party, the charge to meet two tests: it has to be extremely serious and it has to be an airtight case.

And I think both of these cases fail on both of those points.


 





 

Cuomo followed up by recounting a conversation he had with a friend who wanted Trump in prison at all costs. “I think that to the majority, the optics are terrible. If you swing at somebody during an election and you don't have what we deem ‘the goods,’” he disagreed.

The harshest criticism came from Taibbi who suggested the actions of the Department of Justice were like something you would find overseas. “I think if you are a person who grew up in a third-world country, you would recognize this kind of thing is something that in a not-entirely-free society,” he argued. “So, that's the optics of this are terrible. There’s no way around it.”

Trump was being charged under the Espionage Ace and Taibbi recalled how Barack Obama weaponized it when he was president. “Also, you have to consider the context. Barack Obama, who I voted for twice, set the record for the use of the Espionage Act against leakers. He used it against journalists,” he informed viewers. With that in mind, he surmised that “the average person” would view the charges as “kind of a technicality.”

Taibbi did have an idea about what kind of cases would give prosecutors and Trump’s detractors the outcome they wanted:


You know, look, in the case of Donald Trump, if you're going to pick a case and you really think that this is a person who needs to be in jail, I think you've got to pick a really serious case. I mean, I think it had to be connected to January 6th or, you know, voter intimidation in Georgia or something like that. That's something the ordinary voter can say, “All right. I get it. You got to go to trial over that. That's really, really serious. Let's see if they have the evidence for that.” And I think people would accept that.


“But these kinds of cases, you know, paying off of a former prostitute and, you know, now and this case, the retention of records. It's just not the same kind of thing,” he scoffed.

(…)

CHRIS CUOMO: So, these concerns, you know, everybody loves conspiracies these days. I'm not so sure that these investigations aren't done in a way that winds up to intentionally or unintentionally helping the former President to be honest, because every time there's a swing, it seems to expose the fact they go after him with what seems to be at or below a level of anything that would be impressive to people reviewing the documents.

What’s your take on this?

MATT TAIBBI: Yeah, I agree with you. I’m obviously not a fan of Donald Trump. I wrote a book about the guy called Insane Clown President. But you know, my feeling is if you're going to take the very extreme step of indicting somebody who's the likely nominee of the opposition party, the charge to meet two tests: it has to be extremely serious and it has to be an airtight case.

And I think both of these cases fail on both of those points.

CUOMO: You know, a buddy of mine who is a very smart guy and a lawyer, but, you know, just to kind of consumer of all things relevant like yourself. He was like, “Ay, I don't care that it's during the election. The fact that you're running shouldn't shield you. Maybe he's running because he knows it's his best defense on these things.”

Maybe. But I think that to the majority, the optics terrible. If you swing at somebody during an election and you don't have what we deem “the goods.”

Now, what does that look like in this case? Do you think it comes down to, well what are the documents he was keeping?

TAIBBI: Well, again, I mean, I think if you are a person who grew up in a third world country, you would recognize this kind of thing is something that in a not-entirely-free society. So, that's the optics of this are terrible. There’s no way around it.

Also, you have to consider the context. Barack Obama, who I voted for twice, set the record for the use of the Espionage act against leakers. He used it against journalists.

There's also the case involving Julian Assange, which a lot of people think an abuse of power. That's an Espionage Act case.

This case, you know, has a whiff of you know, it's the kind of thing where it's an extremely serious felony that can put somebody away for a lot of years that really to the average person looks like it's kind of a technicality. And I just don't see how they it's going to down to their benefit in an election year.

(…)

8:58:39 p.m. Eastern

CUOMO: Matt, what do you think the fix is?

TAIBBI: The fix? Well, I just think they need to be more transparent and – You know, look, in the case of Donald Trump, if you're going to pick a case and you really think that this is a person who needs to be in jail, I think you've got to pick a really serious case. I mean, I think it had to be connected to January 6th or, you know, voter intimidation in Georgia or something like that.

That's something the ordinary voter can say, “All right. I get it. You got to go to trial over that. That's really, really serious. Let's see if they have the evidence for that.” And I think people would accept that. But these kinds of cases, you know, paying off of a former prostitute and, you know, now and this case, the retention of records. It's just not the same kind of thing.

1618,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","MSNBC Surprised SCOTUS Upheld Voting Rights, Claimed Rights Were Gutted","June 8th, 2023 10:34 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/cassandra-devries/2023/06/08/msnbc-surprised-scotus-upheld-voting-rights-claimed-rights,"MSNBC asked three Democrats to discuss the Supreme Court’s ruling on Alabama’s redistricting plan, neglecting to acknowledge any alternate view point. NBC senior legal correspondent Laura Jarrett, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice Michael Waldman, and former Alabama Democratic Senator Doug Jones expressed surprise that the conservative Supreme Court would uphold Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act when they previously “gutted the 65 [Voting Rights] Act.”

 “While the court isn't breaking new ground by just simply reaffirming what the law has been for the better part of several decades, it was a surprising decision, especially from this conservative majority,” Laura Jarrett said, alluding that a conservative court would traditionally choose to ignore the Voting Rights Act.

 





 

Michael Waldman, author of The Super Majority: How the Supreme Court Divided America, agreed with Jarrett’s assessment and added, “Overwhelmingly, that population growth comes in communities of color, and they are not being represented in the maps that legislatures have drawn. So this will have an impact beyond this one case as these rulings often do, though it is upholding what had been the law for decades.”

Waldman portrayed the court as doing the bare minimum in its ruling, which fits the narrative of his new book. The following quote was a summary of The Super Majority from Waldman’s website and accurately described Waldman’s view of the court:


Its [The Supreme Court’s] ruling in Bruen radically loosened gun safety laws amid an epidemic of mass shootings. West Virginia v. EPA hobbled the government’s ability to fight climate change and other environmental threats. And in Dobbs, the Court revoked the constitutional protection for abortion rights promised by Roe v. Wade and Casey for nearly 50 years. In these rulings, the supermajority relied on “originalism,” a new, extreme, and deeply flawed method of interpreting the Constitution.


Jones, another opponent of conservatism, hinted that Republicans only won the House because of the unconstitutional redistricting and suggested, without evidence throngs of people were out celebrating the verdict. “So, this is a major, major victory. You know, Andrea, I gotta be honest with you. I haven't seen so many people out dancing in the streets since Alabama won their last national football championship. It is really exciting down here,” He asserted.

“That's a big deal when we talk about elections and football in the same breath,” Mitchell quipped, lending him credence.

Continuing to belittle the conservative Supreme Court, Mitchell and Waldman claimed that the court gutted the Civil Rights Act in 2013 and Walden agreed. “This comes after a decade when they gutted the entire rest of the act, especially as it relates to voting rules and not just redistricting. You’re right, John Roberts, as a young lawyer, opposed the provision that he said precedent requires them to uphold today,” he said.

Waldman believed the only way a conservative court would support minority voting rights would be if they felt threatened and needed to protect their reputation. His assertions went unquestioned as did the other allegations aired on MSNBC.

Even when MSNBC agreed with the Supreme Court’s verdict, it still portrayed the conservative court as corrupt. If this is how they treat decisions they support, one can only imagine their response to a decision they dislike.

MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Report6/8/202312:01 p.m. Eastern

MSNBC Presents One Sided Coverage of Supreme Court Ruling

ANDREA MITCHELL: Good day everyone, I'm Andrea Mitchell in New York as the Supreme Court rules today on voting rights. 

In a surprising decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, joined by the three liberal judges and in part by Justice Kavanaugh, upholding a lower court decision, a victory for supporters of the Voting Rights Act, in a case challenging an Alabama redistricting plan. 

And joining me now, NBC senior legal correspondent Laura Jarrett, Michael Waldman, president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice, and author of The Super Majority: How the Supreme Court Divided America, and former Alabama Democratic Senator Doug Jones. So, Laura fill us in on the case, the Chief Justice’s opinion. 

LAURA JARRETT: Yea, so the high court here citing with voting rights advocates who had argued the way that Alabama had gone about drawing up the congressional districts had violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which of course prohibits discrimination on the basis of race. And, the voting rights advocates had said the way that Alabama had gone about doing it, it had crammed the majority of black voters into one single district in a way that diluted their power to elect the candidates of their choice. And today the high court agreed with the voting rights advocates that the lower court had found that the way that the legislature had gone about doing it had violated Section 2. 

And while the court isn't breaking new ground by just simply reaffirming what the law has been for the better part of several decades, it was a surprising decision, especially from this conservative majority. 

MITCHELL: And Michael, I think we’ve got a graphic of the way they had redistricted. And this was, of course, relevant for the 2022 midterms. So the election was decided on that. And it's quite obvious from this graphic how this was made to just have one black -- one minority representative. 

MICHEAL WALDMAN: In Alabama, the election was run using a map a lower court had already declared to be illegal and racially discriminatory, so this is a big win. And it will have an impact across the South and across the country. 

The South is the fastest growing region. Overwhelmingly, that population growth comes in communities of color, and they are not being represented in the maps that legislatures have drawn. So this will have an impact beyond this one case as these rulings often do, though it is upholding what had been the law for decades. 

MITCHELL: Doug Jones, in Alabama, this is a victory, of course, for fellow Democrats, your fellow Democrats, in Alabama, but also potentially states like Louisiana and Georgia, where there are pending cases that could mean more seats for the current House minority. 

DOUG JONES (former senator, AL): Yea, no, there's no question about it. I think people forget sometimes, and Michael just alluded to this. I mean, in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, the black population is growing faster than the Hispanic population. It's very, very significant, and those cases in Georgia and Louisiana are almost identical fact situations. 

And, also, and I think people forget this sometimes. When you are dealing with a House of Representatives that only has a four or five vote majority, this could have made a big difference in the 2022 elections and what we see playing out right now in Congress right now. 

So, this is a major, major victory. You know, Andrea, I gotta be honest with you. I haven't seen so many people out dancing in the streets since Alabama won their last national football championship. It is really exciting down here.

MITCHELL: That's a big deal when we talk about elections and football in the same breath.

(…)

12:05 p.m. Eastern

MITCHELL: Michael, because the Supreme Court – First of all, this chief justice had written before he was on the court even about voting rights. And in 19- In 2013, they gutted the 65 act.

WALDMAN: This comes after a decade when they gutted the entire rest of the act, especially as it relates to voting rules and not just redistricting. You’re right, John Roberts, as a young lawyer, opposed the provision that he said precedent requires them to uphold today.

The question is, they have to be aware – And certainly John Roberts is aware that the court's credibility with the public has collapsed in all the polls because of the rulings last term and with big rulings coming up now. One of the lessons is that people raising their voices, people saying we don't want them to rule this way on something like voting rights, sometimes it might make a big difference.

1619,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Nets Gloat Over SCOTUS Striking Down GOP Congressional Maps in Alabama,"June 8th, 2023 10:31 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/kevin-tober/2023/06/08/nets-gloat-over-scotus-striking-down-gop-congressional-maps-alabama,"On Thursday, the Supreme Court struck down Alabama’s congressional map on the basis that it was a violation of the 1964 Voting Rights Act. The partisan decision was even more head-scratching when it was revealed that so-called conservative justices John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the three leftists on the court. As was expected, the three evening news broadcasts gloated over the ruling. 

ABC’s World News Tonight was the most obnoxious with justice correspondent Terry Moran breathlessly hyping the “Supreme Court stunner.”

“Two conservative Justices, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Brett Kavanaugh joined the court's liberals in striking down Alabama's congressional map that critics said diluted the power of black voters,” Moran gushed. 

“Today's ruling will have immediate impacts on another congressional district in Alabama with a majority black population and more,” he hyped.

 





 

Moran then brought on former President Barack Obama’s corrupt Attorney General Eric Holder to allow him to spout off. “This is gonna have an impact far beyond Alabama and will have an impact on who controls the United States House of Representatives after the 2024 election,” Holder proclaimed. 

After Holder was done, Moran returned on screen and go weak knees: “Already, today, the Cook Political Report which handicaps elections changed its ratings for five House races moving each one toward the Democrats and saying that today's ruling will send shock waves right across the country.”

Over on CBS Evening News, anchor Norah O’Donnell used a news brief to report the news. It was mostly straightforward except for when she declared it a “major victory in the U.S. Supreme Court for the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting.” 

Meanwhile, on NBC Nightly News, legal correspondent Laura Jarrett told anchor Lester Holt that the decision was “a real surprise, especially given the court's past decisions, and one with potentially big implications for 2024 as the high court today reaffirmed the key part of the Voting Rights Act aimed at preventing race discrimination.”

TERRY MORAN: Tonight a Supreme Court stunner. Two conservative Justices, Chief Justice John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the court's liberals in striking down Alabama's congressional map that critics said diluted the power of black voters. In a 5-4 decision the court upheld a lower court ruling that found a redistricting map drawn by the Republican-led Alabama legislature violated the Voting Rights Act because it only drew one district out of seven that had a majority of black voters, even though more than one in four Alabamians are black.

[...]

MORAN: Today's ruling will have immediate impacts on another congressional district in Alabama with a majority black population and more. 

ERIC HOLDER: This is gonna have an impact far beyond Alabama and will have an impact on who controls the United States House of Representatives after the 2024 election.

MORAN: Already, today, the Cook Political Report which handicaps elections changed its ratings for five House races moving each one toward the Democrats and saying that today's ruling will send shock waves right across the country.

NORAH O’DONNELL: Well, tonight, a major victory in the U.S. Supreme Court for the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. In a 5-4 decision the justices struck down Alabama's Republican-drawn congressional map. Which only included one majority-black district. Despite more than one-quarter of the state's population being black. The ruling means Alabama will have to redraw its congressional map to include a second majority-black district. The opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh also joined the court's three liberal justices in the ruling. 

NBC Nightly News
6/8/2023
6:39:17 p.m. Eastern 

LAURA JARRETT: Lester, a real surprise, especially given the court's past decisions, and one with potentially big implications for 2024 as the high court today reaffirmed the key part of the Voting Rights Act aimed at preventing race discrimination. Now the 5-4 decision with Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority sided with those voting rights advocates who argued Alabama lawmakers had drawn their congressional maps in a way that diluted the power of black voters to elect the candidates of their choice by cramming them all into just a single district. That's a move that caused the Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh to side with the court's more liberal members and break with their conservative colleagues.

A company that anyone who has been paying attention knows Biden’s son Hunter was actively involved in. As was frequently the case, the three evening news broadcasts completely ignored the story.  

Instead of covering the news, the big three evening newscasts of ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News instead decided to smear Christian leader Pat Robertson on the day of his death. 

Thanks to exclusive reporting from Fox News Digital’s Brooke Singman, “sources briefed Fox News Digital on the contents of the FBI-generated FD-1023 form alleging a criminal bribery scheme between then-Vice President Joe Biden and a foreign national that involved influence over U.S. policy decisions.” 

According to Signman’s reporting, “The FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020, is the FBI's interview with a ‘highly credible’ confidential source who detailed multiple meetings and conversations he or she had with a top Burisma executive over the course of several years, starting in 2015.” 

“The Burisma executive sought the advice of the confidential source, a business professional, on gaining U.S. oil rights and getting involved with a U.S. oil company,” Fox reported. 

Fox News Digital, added that “the confidential human source believes that the $5 million payment to Joe Biden and the $5 million payment to Hunter Biden occurred, based on his or her conversations with the Burisma executive.” 

Adding to further evidence of a deliberate coverup, “the confidential source said the Burisma executive told him he ‘paid’ the Bidens in such a manner ‘through so many different bank accounts"" that investigators would not be able to ""unravel this for at least 10 years,” Signman revealed. 

One more juicy detail that many conservatives would find amusing is that the document makes a reference to “the Big Guy,” which many have speculated refers to Joe Biden.

Despite the investigation still being in its early stages, Joe Scarborough and Jonathan Lemire, together with the Washington Post’s Jacqueline Alemany teamed up to mock the investigation as “a whole lot of smoke and no fire.”

Together they pushed Congressman Jamie Raskin’s (D-MD) lie about the investigation that Attorney General Bill Barr recently publicly refuted. This blatant assault on an ongoing investigation by Republicans was one more example that showcases the inevitable conclusion that MSNBC is in fact a propaganda arm of the Democrat Party, and willing to use lies to bolster their false narratives whenever possible.





Alemany claimed: “we are told not just by Jamie Raskin but by independent sources who told the Post who are familiar with the document that it was reviewed under Attorney General Bill Barr and Scott Brady, it was assessed and these allegations that the informant made were ultimately closed”.

Unfortunately for Raskin, Attorney General Bill Barr himself publicly confirmed that “It’s not true. It wasn’t closed down … it was sent to Delaware for further investigation.” How could Bill Barr assess and close down the investigation, then come out and say he did not close down the allegations? Someone had to be lying.

Scarborough then railed on that the document was “much ado about nothing”, dismissing the investigation to his co-host Jonathan Lemire, who took it a step further, arguing that the investigation was actually Republicans weaponizing the Federal government against Joe Biden.

Lemire then reasserted the long-repeated Democrat talking point that Republicans were trying to “drag down the President” to provide a distraction for Donald Trump’s own legal problems. Legal problems, which MSNBC has constantly inflated as “the walls closing in on” Trump, even after the Durham Report showed accusations of “Trump-Russia collusion” to be false.

MSNBC thinks it is okay to hype up investigations that end in nothing if Trump is the target, but if Biden is the target, it is the end of the world. Of course, the fact that the allegations were not closed by Bill Barr and the FBI’s insistence that they fear their informant will be killed if the document goes public both indicate there could be something to the investigation. But, if the investigation does reveal no wrongdoing by the President, and turns out to be Republicans going after President Biden’s poll numbers as they say, MSNBC should be offering them a job, not criticism.

MSNBC’s Morning Joe

06/08/23

7:23 AM ET

(…)

JACQUELINE ALEMANY: Yeah, Mika, it’s a lot of back and forth to follow, last night at around 9:30, we were notified that James Comer had agreed to Christopher Wray's offer for all of the lawmakers on the committee to review this 1023 document which we are told not just by Jamie Raskin but by independent sources who told the Post who are familiar with this document that it was reviewed under Attorney General Bill Barr and Scott Brady, it was assessed and these allegations that the confidential informant made were ultimately close. It is possible that this document was then routed, as we discussed on Monday, to another ongoing investigation. But that does not mean that it is that the allegations make in the allegation specifically are being investigated. 

We- lawmakers are expected to be able to view the document potentially today as early as today or next week. But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made it very clear in his own words yesterday: if all of the lawmakers are able to view this document in camera, in person, then there is no contempt vote. James Comer seemed to have ultimately agreed despite a lot of the showboating he was doing around this contempt vote. 

JOE SCARBOROUGH: All right, The Washington Post’s Jackie Alemany, as always thank you so much, appreciate it. 

ALEMANY: Thanks, Joe.

SCAROBOROUGH: And this document itself, my God, Jonathan Lemire, time and again we hear about the document and it seems to the be much ado about nothing. You actually had Chuck Grassley who saw the document, was asked about it and said- said, well does that does the document prove that he’s guilty? And he said, ‘Well it doesn’t matter. We don't care whether he’s guilty or not. We don't care whether he’s guilty or not.’

Again, Barr didn't move on this. The Trump Administration didn't move on this. And again even when Grassley saw it- Grassley, none came out saying that he did anything wrong. There’s just a whole lot of smoke here. And absolutely no fire it seems. 

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Yeah, no, the fires are up in Canada. They’re certainly not, and many of them do with this particular matter. And we saw it we’ve heard it from Grassley you just said, Congressman Comer himself has been on, has given interviews, he has admitted that this is about President Joe Biden's poll numbers, that they don’t recognize, they recognize that there probably isn't something actually there. 

But they’re gonna keep this going. And it is, not to belabor the analogy, it is about a smoke machine here because they are trying to just create distraction, they’re trying to drag down the President as well as try to come up with the equivalence of the legal problems surrounding Donald Trump. Republicans have made clear that their argument all along, Willie, the idea the government, the Federal bureaucracy, was against Donald Trump, was working to undermine him, therefore this is fair play. They’re trying to level the playing field. They’re in their cries of the Federal Government being weaponized against Trump, when really they’re trying to weaponized it against Biden.

But there is at least to this point, no there there. And it also shows there’s been no impact on the President’s poll numbers, and in fact polls suggest they want the Republicans in the House to focus on something that actually matters.

1622,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",DEFUND PBS: Reporter Lobs ‘Question’ to Biden About ‘Anti-LGBTQ’ ‘Intimidation’,"June 8th, 2023 5:14 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2023/06/08/defund-pbs-reporter-lobs-question-biden-about-anti-lgbtq,"White House correspondent Laura Barrón-López of the taxpayer-funded PBS served as an unofficial member of President Biden’s staff Thursday as she lobbed a question at Biden during a press conference with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that spewed falsehoods and hate at “anti-LGBTQ, anti-transgender laws” and how such supporters have “turned violent.”

In response to a supposedly totally organic question, Biden preceded to read from prepared notes calling Americans “callous,” “cruel,” and “prejudiced” if they believe in biology, protecting elementary school students from being shown graphic sex images, and protecting women from biological men in sports. And we know how the last presser went with the questions about it being scripted.

 





 

Barrón-López began by lamenting that “[a]ll over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led states are passing laws — passing anti-LGBTQ, anti-transgender laws that restrict rights and medical care.” Instead of reporting on behalf of Americans who believe men are men or women are women, she chose to view them as the enemy.

She went further, claiming “[i]ntimidation is on the rise” as “[t]his week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.” 

Fact-check: Pants on fire. As reported by our friends at the Daily Signal and Townhall, that’s, at a minimum, debatable with Antifa having played a role in a Glendale, California event with Armenian-Americans enraged by the pro-LGBTQ indoctrination in the school district.

Barrón-López’s faux question eventually culminated in a question mark that tied back to a Monday segment for the PBS NewsHour:


[R]ecently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me they’re afraid and that they’re considering leaving not just their state, but the country. Sir, why do you think this is happening, and what do you say to parents like the ones that I spoke to — to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don’t feel safe anymore?


After asking for that family’s phone number, Biden buried his head in his notes by citing things he’s done for “LGB — LGBT Americans,” but fretted there are too many “hysterical and...prejudiced people” led by “extreme officials” engaging in behavior that’s “totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.”

Biden then falsely claimed someone “can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are — they’re gay.”

Later, he explained the Justice Department will target those engaged in “civil rights violations” against LGBTQ students and the administration will appoint someone “to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.”

No pushback, no fact-checking.

At the end of the presser, Biden took two shouted questions, one serious and one from the left.

The New York Post’s Steven Nelson used this rare opportunity to question Biden on new claims from the House Oversight Committee: “Bribery allegation — Congresswoman Nancy Mace says there’s damning evidence in the FBI file that you sold out the country. Do you have a response to the congressional Republicans?”

With a smirk, Biden blurted out, “Where’s the money? I’m joking. It’s a bunch of malarkey.”

And, for the latter, NBC’s Peter Alexander served as a counterweight to Nelson’s real question: “[W]hat do you say to Americans to convince them that they should trust the independence and fairness of the Justice Department when your predecessor, Donald Trump repeatedly attacks it?”

Biden responded that he’s “never once...suggested the Justice Department what they should do or not do relative to bringing a charge or not bringing a charge” because he’s “honest.”

White House press conference [via ABC News Live]
June 8, 2023
2:36 p.m. Eastern

LAURA BARRÓN LÓPEZ: All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led states are passing laws — passing anti-LGBTQ, anti-transgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California. And also recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me they’re afraid and that they’re considering leaving not just their state, but the country. Sir, why do you think this is happening, and what do you say to parents like the ones that I spoke to — to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don’t feel safe anymore?

2:37 p.m. Eastern

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: First of all, maybe quietly when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them, let them know that the President and this administration has their back and I mean that. Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Acts, strengthen the civil rights protection for LBG — LGBT Americans and advance LGBT human rights around the globe. But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and I would argue prejudiced people who are engaged in all that you see going on around the country. It’s a — it’s an appeal to fear, and it’s appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly. It’s wrong for that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are — they’re gay. It’s wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It’s wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors. These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It’s cruel, and it’s callous. Not somebody else’s kids, all our kids. The kids — and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country, and the fact is that I’m announcing today a series of new initiatives that we are taking to protect the LGBT community, I was going to do this at the fore on the South Lawn. We were having Pride day, but we have to postpone it because of the climate and the weather and the pollution out there — because of the fires. But, number one, we’re going to strengthen the physical safety. Dedicated resources, federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, healthcare providers, and small businesses. Secondly, we are addressing the civil rights violations. A new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time. We’re also engaging mental health and — and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care and steps to end the absolute end of LBTQ homelessness. Congress has to pass — and I’m not giving up on this, just like you told me we couldn’t get the marriage act passed — Congress must pass — must pass equality act and send it to my desk. LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You’re loved, you’re heard, and this administration has your back and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they’re protected.

1623,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Girl Scouts Offer Special Patch For Attending Pride Events,"June 8th, 2023 2:56 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/tierin-rose-mandelburg/2023/06/08/girl-scouts-offer-special-patch-attending-pride,"In honor of Pride Month, the 111-year-old Girl Scouts organization has gone woke yet again, this year offering a special patch for girls to iron on their vests and sashes for scouts who complete “a series of LGBT-themed activities,” as the Daily Caller pointed out. 

The group posted a graphic on June 1 to its Facebook page celebrating ""Pride Month."" The caption stated, “Happy #PrideMonth to all the amazing Girl Scouts in our community!  We celebrate and embrace our unique differences because that's what makes us beautiful. Share how you're celebrating this special month, and don't forget to unlock your next patch too!”

The patch features a rainbow trapezoid type shape that states “I’m a Girl Scout” in the center with “LGBTQ+ Pride Month” printed at the bottom.

The patch can reportedly be earned through any of 20 activities listed on the group's website that troop leaders can assign. Here are just a few:

Make a music playlist featuring 12 LGBTQ+ artists. Talk about which songs you like the most
	Visit the National Women’s History Museum website and read about LGBTQ historical figures and how they advocated for their community in the larger gay movement. Share what you learned with your troop or family.
	Have a watch party with your family or troop of New York University’s Stonewall at 50 documentary , currently streaming for free on YouTube. Discuss what you learned and felt with your group
	Attend an LGBTQ+ Pride celebration in June with your family or troop
 

The Girl Scouts group of Eastern Massachusetts posted on social media that their scouts had participated in a Pride parade where they held and waved rainbow-printed flags and banners. The caption for the post stated, “At Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts, we center diversity, belonging, and inclusion by welcoming everyone who identifies as a girl, transgender boys, non-binary youth members, and adults of all genders. This month and every month, we are proud to stand in support of our LGBTQIA+ Girl Scouts and community members who continue to face hate, discrimination, and violence for living as they are.”

In response to the targeted attack on young Girl Scouts, people who actually care bout children fumed on Twitter. 

Vivek Ramaswamy, who's currently running for the Republican presidential nomination, stated, “Affirming” a kid’s confusion isn’t compassion. It’s cruelty. Trans is a mental health illness and should be treated as such. Protect our kids.”

One user stated, “Just a matter of time till they'll be going door-to-door selling Girl Scout strap-ons!-(“

While that seems barbaric, it doesn’t seem that it would be that far off from the woke mob.

Another insisted, “Never forget they’re coming for your kids.”

The Girl Scouts organization claims they strive to build “girls of courage, confidence, and character, who make the world a better place.” I don’t think that forcing girls to affirm people' sexual orientations and walk in ""Pride"" parades is a way to build their courage, and judging by the extreme profanities and displays of perversion displayed throughout today's ""Pride"" events, I don’t think these young kids will be learning how to “make the world a better place.”

This is all just part of a charade to target young, impressionable kids and create an army of confused people to parrot woke propaganda.

1624,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","NPR or DNC? Jeffries Whacks 'Extreme' GOP Five Times, Compares Pelosi to Michael Jordan","June 8th, 2023 2:14 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/08/npr-or-dnc-jeffries-whacks-extreme-gop-five-times-compares-pelosi,"National Public Radio sounds like DNC Radio. In January, NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep helpfully interviewed new House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the network promoted his boast “We are not going to pay a ransom note to extremists in the other party.""

 Five months later, now that the parties agreed on the debt ceiling -- ""ransom note"" paid? -- All Things Considered host Juana Summers interviewed Jeffries again for eight minutes on Wednesday, and it was a festival of talk about “extreme MAGA Republicans.” Summers began: “The deal was brokered by the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who presides over a narrow House majority including a significant vocal group of hardline conservatives.”

Inside the blue bubble of NPR, there’s no such thing as hardline leftists. Summers could only ask Jeffries “whether Democrats had given away too much,” and added “There are a number of progressive Democrats who have made the point that they were dissatisfied with some parts of this deal.”

Jeffries uncorked the “extreme” label on Republicans five times, with zero pushback from NPR. MRC's Bill D'Agostino put the audio clips together: 






""It was incredibly important that we avoid this dangerous default, even though there were many extreme MAGA Republicans who were determined to bring that about...

[T]here was a willingness by some extreme right wing folks on the other side of the aisle to actually default on our debt, crash the economy and trigger a job-killing recession in order to extract maximum pain on the economy...

It's extraordinary when you think about the fact that extreme MAGA Republicans were determined to reduce the number of people who had access to nutritional benefit programs in the United States. 

Either the House will be unable to function at all because the extreme MAGA Republican wing of the House Republican Conference is determined to bring about a ""my way or the highway"" situation... 

If extreme MAGA Republicans think that they can extract concessions that are inconsistent with what the American people want, they are badly mistaken.


At the end, Summers asked for a Pelosi celebration: ""Your predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, was known for her political acumen, her ability to count votes well. I'm curious, how would you characterize your style in this role compared to her style in this role?"" Jeffries called Pelosi an ""iconic, legendary leader"" and he didn't want to compare himself to that. 

Summers asked again: ""How would you characterize your style in this role versus her style? I mean, it is an interesting dynamic having your predecessor still as a member of the House while you are now in this new job."" Jeffries then bizarrely went for the NBA analogy: ""I'll leave it to others to characterize my style other than to say that it's very difficult to follow Michael Jordan, and I'm following Michael Jordan.""

PS: Jeffries also drew the softball treatment (no Biden scandal questions) on PBS NewsHour. 

And House Minority Whip Katherine Clark just drew a similar softball interview from NPR where she was allowed to whack away at the House GOP.",279068,,['Tim Graham'],"['American', 'Republicans', 'the United States', 'Democrats', 'Republican']","['Katherine Clark', 'Jeffries', ""Bill D'Agostino"", 'Steve Inskeep', 'Summers', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'Michael Jordan', 'Kevin McCarthy', 'Biden', 'Hakeem Jeffries', 'Juana Summers', 'Pelosi']","['the House Republican Conference', 'the White House', 'MRC', 'House', 'NBA', 'NPR Morning Edition', 'NPR', 'National Public Radio', 'GOP', 'DNC Radio', 'PBS NewsHour', 'DNC']","['NPR', 'DNC', 'Jeffries', ""'Extreme' GOP"", 'Pelosi', 'Michael Jordan', 'National Public Radio', 'DNC Radio', 'January', 'NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep', 'new House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries', 'the network', 'his boast', 'We', 'a ransom note', 'extremists', 'the other party', 'the parties', 'the debt ceiling', 'All Things Considered host Juana Summers', 'Jeffries', 'eight minutes', 'Wednesday', 'it', 'a festival', 'talk', 'extreme MAGA Republicans', 'Summers', 'The deal', 'the White House', 'House Speaker Kevin McCarthy', 'who', 'a narrow House majority', 'a significant vocal group', 'hardline conservatives', 'the blue bubble', 'NPR', 'no such thing', 'hardline leftists', 'Summers', 'Jeffries', 'Democrats', 'a number', 'progressive Democrats', 'who', 'the point', 'they', 'some parts', 'this deal', 'Jeffries', 'the “extreme” label', 'Republicans', 'zero pushback', 'NPR', ""MRC's Bill D'Agostino"", 'the audio clips', 'It', 'we', 'this dangerous default', 'many extreme MAGA Republicans', 'who', 'that', 'a willingness', 'some extreme right wing folks', 'the other side', 'the aisle', 'our debt', 'the economy', 'a job-killing recession', 'order', 'maximum pain', 'the economy', 'It', 'you', 'the fact', 'extreme MAGA Republicans', 'the number', 'people', 'who', 'access', 'nutritional benefit programs', 'the United States', 'the House', 'the extreme MAGA Republican wing', 'the House Republican Conference', 'a ""my way or the highway"" situation', 'extreme MAGA Republicans', 'they', 'concessions', 'that', 'what', 'the American people', 'they', 'the end', 'Summers', 'a Pelosi celebration', 'Your predecessor', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'her political acumen', 'her ability', 'votes', 'I', 'you', 'your style', 'this role', 'her style', 'this role', 'Jeffries', 'Pelosi', 'an ""iconic, legendary leader', 'he', 'himself', 'that', 'Summers', 'you', 'your style', 'this role', 'her style', 'I', 'it', 'an interesting dynamic', 'your predecessor', 'a member', 'the House', 'you', 'this new job', 'Jeffries', 'the NBA analogy', 'I', 'it', 'others', 'my style', 'it', 'Michael Jordan', 'I', 'Michael Jordan', 'PS', 'Jeffries', 'the softball treatment', 'no Biden scandal questions', 'PBS NewsHour', 'House Minority Whip Katherine Clark', 'a similar softball interview', 'NPR', 'she', 'the House GOP', 'None']"

And why it matters is, in part, Wednesday’s briefing revealed how they’re just as far to the left as VOA reporter Anita Powell put a softball question about Pride Month on the tee for Press Secretary (and heralded lesbian) Karine Jean-Pierre.

Powell mentioned that Thursday would feature a Pride Month event at the White House, but fretted this would “provoke some political or politicized pushback, especially from, you know, some of the states that have passed legislation targeting sexual minorities or from countries that have done the same.”

 





 

In turn, Powell asked if she “could...just hear from you why does the White House feel that this event is important, especially in this context.”

Puketastic. Worthless media we have.

Of course, Jean-Pierre was eager to take the question, citing “multiple events celebrating the LGBTQ+ community” put on by an administration led by “strong all[ies]” in President Biden, Vice President Harris, and their spouses.

Jean-Pierre continued to wax poetic about how “they feel it’s important to lift up a community, to lift up their accomplishments and what they’ve been able to do for the community” as transgender children are being attacked by an “‘anti’-sentiment.”

Instead, she explained, trans kids and the rest of the LGBTQ+ world “need to be celebrated and continue to be celebrated, as he’s done many times before in this — in this past two years, but we also need to make sure that we let the community know that the President has their back and we’re going to continue to fight for them”.

“I think that is important to be able to bring a couple of thousand Americans here to the White House to let them know that this President is going to continue to fight for them. And that’s the message that we want to make sure that gets out there,” she concluded.

Elsewhere. Some reporters chose to actually show up to work and challenge Jena-Pierre

While Fox’s Jacqui Heinrich drew a no comment on a question about judicial precedent Hunter Biden’s legal team could employ if he’s indicted, her colleague Edward Lawrence at the Fox Business Network brought up the rise in retail theft and whether Biden finds that acceptable (click “expand”):


LAWRENCE: So, Walgreens unveiled a new look for their stores; they unveiled that in Chicago and it has basically everything locked up, in part because of the theft that they have seen. A recent study shows that 50 percent of retail workers have seen some sort of retail theft, and another nearly 50 percent are afraid to go to work, do is the President aware of retail theft? And how come the problem has become so persa — per — pervasive under his tenure?

JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, what I can tell you is: Unlike congressional Republicans, the President has taken action. He has taken action to deal with — with the crime, hiring police officers. We’ve — you’ve seen that from his actions that he’s taken to cut crime and he — and it started with the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan had billions of dollars that went into communities to hire police officers, to make sure that we held — we had accountability, as well, on the ground and let’s not forget his Safer American [sic] Plan to fund the police and invest in crime prevention. So, we have taken actions. We have made sure that we do everything that we can to try and protect communities and to make sure that police officers are hired and so, look, instead of Congress, you know, passing legislation or wanting to cut or defund the police, we’re doing the opposite and so we would love to work with Congress and see how else we can be helpful to communities. But the President has taken action — again, the American Rescue Plan, the Safer communities — Safer community — America Plan — and he’s going to continue to do what he can to make sure that we keep communities safe.


Right before Lawrence, Bloomberg’s Jenny Leonard resurrected a possible TikTok ban by wondering whether there’s been any movement. Of course, the ever-useless Jean-Pierre ducked.

And in the final exchange, CBS’s Ed O’Keefe took notice of how, throughout the briefing, Jean-Pierre dodged commenting on what’s essentially a merger between the PGA and the Saudi-backed LIV golf tour, but she had plenty to say about various bank mergers as well as when Elon Musk bought Twitter.

Jean-Pierre naturally insisted she wasn’t being a hypocrite or caving to the Saudis (click “expand”):


O’KEEFE: You said repeatedly here that the White House didn’t want to comment on a private entity. A quick search back through briefings in recent months finds that you commented on JPMorgan’s merger or purchase of First Republic and then you were asked last November about Elon Musk buying Twitter, saying: “We’re going to keep an eye on that decision”...Does the decision to not comment today have anything to do with the fact that the Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia right now?

JEAN-PIERRE: No, not at all. Not at all. We’re just not going to comment on this and — and, look, I also said with the mer — the — the Elon Musk — I also said the same thing that I said today: is that we’re not going to comment on a private entity. I actually said those words, as we talked about Elon Musk and Twitter and so that’s going to continue. We’re not going to comment on this. We’re going to focus on the American people. We’re going to focus on — on what their needs...[T]hat’s the President’s focus right now...We just are not — not going to comment on — on any types of mergers...I also continued and said I’m just not going to comment on mergers or private entities.

White House press briefing [via ABC News Live]
June 7, 2023
2:05 p.m. Eastern

JENNY LEONARD: A couple of months ago, we were all talking about TikTok, and there was legislation put forward on the Hill that three months ago Jake Sullivan came out in support of, and then we haven’t really heard much since. Can you say whether you’re working at all with the Hill on making this become law?  Are you working with the Senate, the House? Or have you sort of given up on any authority to restrict TikTok and other apps that you think are harmful?

KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, it — certainly this is important to the President, to the administration, this type of legislation that Jake talked about a couple of months ago. I don’t have an update for you. We are always in constant contact on different pieces of legislation with the House and the Senate. I just don’t have an update on where we are currently with this particular legislation. [TO LAWRENCE] Go ahead.

EDWARD LAWRENCE: Thanks, Karine. So, Walgreens unveiled a new look for their stores; they unveiled that in Chicago snd it has basically everything locked up, in part because of the theft that they have seen. A recent study shows that 50 percent of retail workers have seen some sort of retail theft, and another nearly 50 percent are afraid to go to work, do is the President aware of retail theft? And how come the problem has become so persa — per — pervasive under his tenure?

JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, what I can tell you is: Unlike congressional Republicans, the President has taken action. He has taken action to deal with — with the crime, hiring police officers. We’ve — you’ve seen that from his actions that he’s taken to cut crime and he — and it started with the American Rescue Plan. The American Rescue Plan had billions of dollars that went into communities to hire police officers, to make sure that we held — we had accountability, as well, on the ground and let’s not forget his Safer American [sic] Plan to fund the police and invest in crime prevention. So, we have taken actions. We have made sure that we do everything that we can to try and protect communities and to make sure that police officers are hired and so, look, instead of Congress, you know, passing legislation or wanting to cut or defund the police, we’re doing the opposite and so we would love to work with Congress and see how else we can be helpful to communities. But the President has taken action — again, the American Rescue Plan, the Safer communities — Safer community — America Plan — and he’s going to continue to do what he can to make sure that we keep communities safe.

2:18 p.m. Eastern

JACQUI HEINRICH: I know you won’t comment on the case involving the President’s son, but the President previously criticized the Supreme Court ruling that his legal team is preparing to use, should he be charged, as an affront to common sense and the Constitution. I just want to know if that statement from June of last year still holds or if he is viewing that ruling in a new light.

JEAN-PIERRE: I’m just not going to comment on this.

(....)

2:23 p.m. Eastern

ANITA POWELL: Moving on to the Pride event tomorrow. This is likely to provoke some political or politicized pushback, especially from, you know, some of the states that have passed legislation targeting sexual minorities or from countries that have done the same, so could I just hear from you why does the White House feel that this event is important, especially in this context?

JEAN-PIERRE: So we’ve had multiple events celebrating the LGBTQ+ community. Multiple.  And this is a President that has been a strong ally; a Vice President that has been a strong ally; a Second Gentleman, a First Lady that has been a strong ally of the — of the community and it is important — he feels it is important, they feel it’s important to lift up a community, to lift up their accomplishments and what they’ve been able to do for the community. And so, we think it’s an important moment and let’s not forget what we’re seeing across the country from statehouses: more than 600 pieces of legislation, anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. A few hundred of those are against transgender youth and so we have not seen that type of “anti” sentiment, anti — against this community in decades. And so, we believe that not only does this community need to be celebrated and continue to be celebrated, as he’s done many times before in this — in this past two years, but we also need to make sure that we let the community know that the President has their back and we’re going to continue to fight for them and so that is important and I think that is important to be able to bring a couple of thousand Americans here to the White House to let them know that this President is going to continue to fight for them. And that’s the message that we want to make sure that gets out there.

ED O’KEEFE: Could I just clarify one thing, Karine? You said repeatedly here that the White House didn’t want to comment on a private entity. A quick search back through briefings in recent months finds that you commented on JPMorgan’s merger or purchase of First Republic and then you were asked last November about Elon Musk buying Twitter, saying: “We’re going to keep an eye on that decision.”

JEAN-PIERRE: And I —

O’KEEFE: Does the decision to not comment today have anything to do with the fact that the Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia right now?

JEAN-PIERRE: No, not at all. Not at all.

I actually said those words, as we talked about Elon Musk and Twitter and so that’s going to continue. We’re not going to comment on this. We’re going to focus on the American people. We’re going to focus on — on what their needs are as it relates to, you know, American families and as it relates to abroad and also the Middle East as well and so that’s the President’s focus right now, but I’ve always been very clear: We just are not — not going to comment on — on any types of mergers and I know you pulled out those — those specific things, but I also continued and said I’m

1626,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",MRC VP Dan Schneider Calls AI a Threat to Humanity’s ‘Entire Existence’,"June 8th, 2023 12:00 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/luis-cornelio/2023/06/08/mrc-vp-dan-schneider-calls-ai-threat-humanitys-entire,"MRC Free Speech America Vice President Dan Schneider warned that a lack of artificial intelligence regulation will lead to the destruction of humanity as we now know it.

Schneider joined the Fox Business Network’s The Evening Edit and commented on growing congressional concerns about the rapid development of AI. Schneider, who has raised the alarm about the dangers of AI before, detailed a chilling story of how AI could become the radical far-left’s “greatest tool” to “socialize America” and cause the destruction of humanity. Schneider cautioned that although there are positive aspects of AI, they are, outweighed by the imminent dangers.





“The downside is that it is a threat to our entire existence, the way we think through things, the way we control things,” a fired-up Schneider told host Elizabeth MacDonald. “Social media companies do not want the government to put parameters on them because they like to try to create societies in their own image,” Schneider added of the role of Big Tech in drafting AI regulations.

The rush for AI regulations has prompted several federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, to make AI woke and promote leftist talking points, a point Schneider brought up in the insightful interview. “Artificial intelligence will be the greatest tool the left  — whether we're talking about members of Congress, the Biden administration or these tech companies — the greatest tool they have ever had to socialize America.”

Earlier this year, several Biden agencies — including the FTC, DOJ, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission — issued a partisan joint statement pledging to uphold AI to the so-called “core principles of fairness, equality, and justice.” These words are, of course, mere euphemisms for ultimately pushing AI development toward the leftist’s utopian socialist vision.

Even China recognized the unprecedented power of AI technology as the Chinese Communist Party races the U.S. in molding its AI regulations to reflect the inhumane core values of Marxism. But Schneider warned that the U.S. must beat China.

“We have to win the AI race,” Schneider declared, while also warning against the Biden administration’s attempt to weaponize AI to their political advantage. “At the same time, the companies in America that are supposed to be leading this, they are sort of bought and sold by the Democrat Party and vice versa,” Schneider noted, however, that not all hope is lost. “I can not tell you how happy I am that Senator Josh Hawley is taking this seriously. He is the first Republican in Congress to take this issue seriously. He has recommended five guiding principles. Most of those principles I think are good, but we need to go deeper,” he added. “We have got to protect us from these tech executives who really do not have our interests at heart.”

Conservatives are under attack. Contact the U.S. Commerce Department and demand that Big Tech developers of artificial intelligence technologies mirror the First Amendment while providing transparency, clarity on so-called hate speech and equal footing for conservatives.

1627,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","CBS Brings in Leftists Gorman, Kendi to Screech Racism in ‘Banned Books’ Fight","June 8th, 2023 11:57 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/curtis-houck/2023/06/08/cbs-brings-leftists-gorman-kendi-screech-racism-banned-books-fight,"Based on how the second hour of Wednesday’s CBS Mornings went, they showed they’re not interested in earning the trust of conservatives as they dedicate segments to far-left authors Amanda Gorman and Ibram X. Kendi to cry homophobia, transphobia, and racism over parents in Florida and other conservative locales wanting a role in the books and curriculum in the education system.

Co-host and Democratic donor Gayle King was ebullient with this hour of wokeness, gushing first over Gorman in a tease that she’d be speaking out after “her inaugural poem was restricted by a Florida school following a parent’s complaint,” another chapter in the “growing trend...of limiting access to books that deal with racism and other issues.”

 





 

In a second tease, King lamented Gorman’s work being “restricted,” adding the show would ask her “about the rise of book banning”. Gorman led off the second hour with King engaging in more disinformation, again referring to the rise in “banning books.”

Gorman’s case wasn’t any sort of ban, so all uses of “ban” in the segment were comical in nature given the book was assessed to be better tagged for middle schoolers and could be requested by students in the library’s media center.

Nonetheless, King swooned (click “expand”):


KING: We’re going to begin this hour with poet and best-selling author, that’s Amanda Gorman, who joins us for her first interview about banning books. Now you may remember, she captivated the country — and captivated is the word here — back in 2021 when she became the youngest poet at a presidential inauguration in U.S. history. We remember this day. Here’s a look.

[GORMAN CLIP]

KING: Still gives me goosebumps. Her poem, The Hill We Climb was later published as a book, and recently, a Florida elementary school restricted access to the book after one parent complained and filed a complaint. Access to three other books was also restricted including one that’s no longer in print. In a statement to CBS News, Miami-Dade County Public School said this: “No literature has been banned or removed and that the school determined ‘The Hill We Climb’ was better suited for middle school students.” Well last night, Amanda Gorman donated 1,200 books for a banned book giveaway event hosted by a Florida bookstore including her own and the two other restricted titles that are still in print. 


Despite saying there that the book was “restricted” (which is still a stretch), King trashed the fact that “one parent” couldn’t leave well enough alone and instead complained about what they believed was something by Oprah.

Gorman responded to King’s question about how she felt upon hearing the change by saying she felt “a mix of shock and sadness” and “couldn’t understand” why her poem (taking a woke view) about America wasn’t spread far and wide due to this “significant moment in our democratic history.”

Gorman’s narcissism showed in adding that not spreading the poem amounted to “young people” being “erased” when they “deserve to see themselves.”

To his credit, co-host Tony Dokoupil repeatedly offered the view of right-of-center parents, noting hers and other “books are still available at every bookstore, your book, your words all over the internet” and “can be checked out a public libraries,” so it’s actually false to claim they’re “banned.”

Gorman briefly entertained that seeing as how the books aren’t subjected to a ritual burning, but went back to using the “banned” term, lamenting her book’s move to a media center was an undue burden.

Dokoupil kept pressing, citing “parent anxiety” over “lost control of” what their children are taught, but
Gorman didn’t want that and lashed out at the parent who raised concerns because such ilk are hindering “freedom to really absorb and love and enjoy literature”.

King and co-host Vladimir Duthiers then teed Gorman up to claim concerned were arguing it’s “inappropriate” for someone to be black or gay or an immigrant (click “expand”):


KING: And again, one person who allegedly didn’t read the book, that’s the thing that strikes me, too. She didn’t even read the book.

GORMAN: Right. It shows how little goes into some of these complaints. Exactly.

DUTHIERS: So Amanda, it’s Vlad. Speaking of the exposure of ideas and concepts that perhaps young children will be exposed to, through your book, “The Hill We Climb” or “The ABCs of Black History,” “Love to Langston,” what is your understanding of what people find inappropriate in those books?

GORMAN: So if you look at the research, the majority of books that have been banned fall into two camps. Either they have characters of color or talk about race in some way, or they have characters that are of the LGBTQ community or touch upon those themes in some way and I have to think about what messaging that sends to young readers. It is as if you’re saying, you are inappropriate if you are African-American. You are inappropriate if you are gay. You are inappropriate if you are an immigrant and there is this huge argument that it is about protecting and sheltering our children from themes that are just too advanced from them, but when you look at the majority of the books that have actually been banned, it’s more about creating a bookshelf that doesn’t represent the diverse facets of America.

BURLESON: Amanda, Nate here. I would like to end by reading some of your words, if you would allow me. To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of men, and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide, because we know to put our country first, we must first put our differences aside. Amanda Gorman, thank you so much. We appreciate you joining us.

GORMAN: Thank you so much.

KING: That was beautifully done, Nate. I say, and the controversy with that is what? Come again?

DUTHIERS: Exactly.


As for the Kendi interview, he began by explaining he went the graphic novel route so he can get your kids hooked from an early age: “I’m just constantly thinking about ways to reach everyday people, young people and older people with this history of racist ideas.”

Again to his credit, Dokoupil presented the counter: “The topic of this book, ideas that go back to the founding and even before and Republicans on the campaign trail will say America is not a racist country. This book would say otherwise. What’s your response to that political conversation?”

The soft-talking authoritarian and CBS News contributor proclaimed America (except certain racial groups with certain viewpoints, of course) being deeply racist “isn’t actually...up for debate.”

Dokoupil kept presenting the Republican position, noting Kendi often “sounds like” racial equality isn’t progressing forward while “people on the right would say” we should “acknowledge...all of the racial progress and improvements.”

Kendi insisted there’s been a “progression of racism” through American life with a spectacularly dumb example of how “ voter suppression policies today are much more sophisticated”.

Kendi wound down by lamenting the work of black and LGBTQ authors have been deemed not appropriate for all ages. Thankfully, Dokoupil had one final pushback (click “expand”):


KENDI: I think that we create books like others do, that are going to be able to reach children, that children are going to be able to understand, in which they’re going to see themselves and unfortunately, particularly Black authors, authors of color, LGBTQ authors, our books are being banned as somehow not age appropriate. So, I mean, what does that say? You know, I think that’s one of the things that Amanda talked about. And I could also say that what’s really difficult for me as a parent is that books are being banned, but not guns.

DOKOUPIL: Yes. But you know, I think one of the questions people have is, what’s the role of school? Is it to educate? Yes. But is it also to create a citizen, a patriot of a country who has a stake in that country, believes in it, and people on the right will say, well, this doesn’t make people love America, this is the opposite of that.

KENDI: Well, if you read Stamped From the Beginning, you’ll see figures like Angela Davis and a whole host of other figures who are challenging critically this nation’s laws and policies and figures to transform it, to make it better.

The Chinese Communist Party reportedly enjoyed full access to the data of Hong Kong TikTok users, according to Yintao Yu, a former executive for TikTok’s parent company at ByteDance. The allegations came up in a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit.

This new development just further underscores TikTok’s dangerous ties to China, an assessment that its controversy-embroiled parent company ByteDance “denies,” according to The Journal.

The former executive accused the CCP of having a “superuser” account, disturbingly known as a “god credential,” which Yu said gave the communist Chinese government access to all consumers’ data through a “backdoor channel.”

Yu said that the purpose of this unfettered access was to further strengthen the Chinese government’s authoritative hold of Hong Kong by unveiling the identity and location of pro-freedom protestors. The former engineering chief worked for ByteDance’s Los Angeles-based office from 2017 to 2018, according to The Wall Street Journal. Yu’s lawsuit — filed in California — accused CCP members of accessing the personal information of pro-freedom activists in Hong Kong, including their cell phone data and IP addresses.

In the lawsuit, Yu accused TikTok of illegally “stealing content” from Big Tech apps, including Snapchat and Instagram, and of fabricating an army of fake accounts to increase engagement on the now-infamous app, according to The New York Times. Yu said he came across logs that unveiled that members of the CCP had accessed the personal information of Hong Kong pro-freedom protestors, including their supporters.

ByteDance has denied these damning new allegations with demonstrably dubious claims. “We vigorously oppose what we believe are baseless claims and allegations in this complaint,” a spokeswoman for ByteDance claimed in a statement to The Journal. The spokeswoman alleged that Yu did not even work for TikTok but for the now-discontinued Flipagram app.

However, ByteDance is in effect assuming consumers will ignore the fact it bought Flipagram, a video editing app, in 2017 and then used Flipagram’s technology to launch TikTok’s predecessor app, Musical.ly, according to Productmint. As it has been widely documented, Musical.ly then became TikTok.

1629,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",PolitiFact Defends Target for Backing Group Pushing Secret Child Gender Transitions,"June 8th, 2023 11:33 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/06/08/politifact-defends-target-backing-group-pushing-secret-child,"PolitiFact has shown no hesitation when it comes to rating conservative claims about Target false, but when it came to a recent true claim from The Daily Wire and Fox News, about Target funding GLSEN, an activist group that favors concealing child transitions from parents, author Madison Czopek declined to give them a true rating on Wednesday, likely because PolitiFact believes such concealments are good.

GLSEN — or Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network — was Czopek described as a group that “supports LGBTQ+ inclusion, affirmation and safety in schools,” was alluded to in a May 26 Daily Wire headline, “Target Donates To Group That Promotes Secret Child Gender Transitions, LGBTQ Books In Schools.”

Additionally, Fox News summed up the situation this way: “Target partners with org pushing for kids’ genders to be secretly changed in schools without parental consent.” Czopek also cited an Instagram post claiming Target was “promoting and paying for sex changes.”

Despite claiming “these claims go too far” in suggesting Target “is advocating or paying for sex changes for kids,” Czopek nevertheless conceded, “GLSEN supports educational policies that aim to keep LGBTQ+ students safe in situations in which their gender identities may not be welcome at home.”

Czopek reports that Target gave GLSEN $250,000 in 2022 and has given them $2.1 million throughout their 11-year partnership. She also writes:


Schools often don’t make a practice of informing parents when students signal they are socially transitioning, The Washington Post reported. A transition can involve students, their teachers and their peers using the name and pronouns that align with the students’ gender identities. Critics argue that schools and educators should not keep information about a student from parents or guardians.


As for GLSEN’s “model policy,” it directs schools in how they “should support transgender and nonbinary students — an example of the type of policy the group champions. It states that educators ‘shall not disclose any information that may reveal a student’s gender identity to others, including parents or guardians and other staff, unless the student has authorized such disclosure.’"" 

In other words, The Daily Wire and Fox News are factually correct, but PolitiFact won’t give them a true rating because they support a policy that readers of those outlets oppose.

Continuing with the theme that concealing gender transitions from parents is actually a good thing, Czopek defends GLSEN because other left-wing organizations agree with them:


GLSEN's policy aligns with practices promoted by other organizations, including the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Psychological Association and Teaching Tolerance, a Southern Poverty Law Center project. Those organizations urge schools and school staffs to respect students’ right to privacy regarding their sexual orientation and gender identity; they also promote school policies that prohibit disclosure of such information to anyone without students’ permission.


Czopek concludes with a dire warning should The Daily Wire get its way, “Allowing youth to come out to their friends and family members on their own terms is important — and ""outing"" a student to their parents ""could result in catastrophic consequences,"" [GLSEN Executive Director Melanie] Willingham-Jaggers said.”

Well, it seems the progressives have infiltrated good 'ole North Carolina. 

During a June 6 school board meeting for the Wake County Public School System that surrounds Raleigh, North Carolina, one mother, Crystal Amanchukwu, addressed the woke agenda in schools. Specifically, she brought up one book that’s permitted in schools called “Queer” which explicitly details sexual acts and other inappropriate content. 

Amanchukwu is the wife of preacher, John Amanchukwu Sr. He’s been outspoken lately about other heinous books and concepts in school districts and spoke at the June 6 hearing as well. His wife read passages from “Queer” and exposed how pro-groomer the district really is. 

Warning: highly explicit content.

 





 

Ms. Amanchukwu began her speech expressing her concern about the “priority of academic advancement and our need to invest more resources in the right places and less in the wrong places,” i.e. pornographic content for kids. 

She then turned her attention to the book “Queer,” which is described as “The Ultimate LGBT Guide for Teens,"" a book is available throughout high schools throughout the Wake County area. 

In the book, explicit descriptions of sex were present. “There are a gazillion ways to have sex,” part of it said, adding, “not all trans guys wear dildos.” The book, yes, again which is marketed towards teens, encouraged readers to get “lots of practice” having sex to figure out which of the sex “rainbow” of choices you prefer. 

Ms. Amanchukwu went on to talk about a section of the book that detailed “genital stimulation.” The authors insisted that there are various ways to execute this including rubbing “your private parts on someones … ankles.” Never heard of grinding someone’s ankle but … OK. 

To take it a step further, she discussed how the book talked about anal sex in great detail. “This can involve penetration with the penis, fingers or a sex toy,” she stated, adding “for care of the sex toy it talks about [how] ‘the anus has lots of bacteria [and] when spread elsewhere can cause problems. If you’re going to use a sex toy for anal penetration, be sure to use one that is silicon, as long as it doesn’t have electrical components. Just boil it for five minutes and run it through the dishwasher.'” 

At this moment you could hear others in the room respond with what sounded like shock and disgust. One man who was in the frame of the video was even spotted shaking his head in disapproval. 

The book also noted that “penetrating the anus with a foreign object like food, can be dangerous.” It didn’t say anal sex with food “IS” dangerous, just that it “can be.”

Ms. Amanchukwu concluded her speech by announcing that the book is not “informational” but rather that it’s “instructional.”

She’s spot on. School districts and systems have a very clear agenda and it’s to start young, with impressionable kids and adolescents, and get them to jump on the bandwagon of wokeness. Public schools don’t want to train students to think for themselves or learn how to function in society. They want to indoctrinate students into believing the lies of the left and this book is a prime example of that. 

We’ll leave you with the final statement of Ms. Amanchukwu’s speech. “Let’s go back to being a school.”",279069,,['Tierin-Rose Mandelburg'],"['Wake County', 'Raleigh', 'North Carolina', 'the Bible Belt']","['John Amanchukwu Sr.', 'Crystal Amanchukwu', 'Amanchukwu']",['the Wake County Public School System'],"[""'Queer' Book"", 'Students', 'Private Parts', 'Ankles', 'Sex Toys', 'Some', 'the Bible Belt', 'some protection', 'some radical leftist ideas', 'it', 'the progressives', ""good 'ole North Carolina"", 'a June 6 school board meeting', 'the Wake County Public School System', 'that', 'Raleigh', 'North Carolina', 'one mother', 'Crystal Amanchukwu', 'the woke agenda', 'schools', 'she', 'one book', 'that', 'schools', '“Queer', 'which', 'sexual acts', 'other inappropriate content', 'Amanchukwu', 'the wife', 'preacher', 'John Amanchukwu Sr', 'He', 'other heinous books', 'concepts', 'school districts', 'the June 6 hearing', 'His wife', 'passages', 'Queer', 'the district', '\xa0\n\nWarning', 'highly explicit content', 'Ms. Amanchukwu', 'her speech', 'her concern', 'the “priority', 'academic advancement', 'our need', 'more resources', 'the right places', 'the wrong places', 'i.e. pornographic content', 'kids', 'She', 'her attention', 'the book', 'Queer', 'which', '“The Ultimate LGBT Guide', 'Teens', 'a book', 'high schools', 'the Wake County area', 'the book', 'explicit descriptions', 'sex', 'a gazillion ways', 'sex', 'part', 'it', 'not all trans guys', 'dildos', 'The book', 'which', 'teens', 'readers', 'lots', 'practice', 'sex', 'which', 'the sex “rainbow', 'choices', 'you', 'Ms. Amanchukwu', 'a section', 'the book', 'that', 'genital stimulation', 'The authors', 'various ways', 'this', 'your private parts', 'someones … ankles', 'someone’s ankle', 'it', 'she', 'the book', 'anal sex', 'great detail', 'This', 'penetration', 'the penis', 'fingers', 'a sex toy', 'she', 'care', 'the sex toy', 'it', 'the anus', 'lots', 'bacteria', 'problems', 'you', 'a sex toy', 'anal penetration', 'one', 'that', 'silicon', 'it', 'electrical components', 'it', 'five minutes', 'it', 'the dishwasher', 'this moment', 'you', 'others', 'the room', 'what', 'shock', 'disgust', 'One man', 'who', 'the frame', 'the video', 'his head', 'disapproval', 'The book', 'the anus', 'a foreign object', 'food', 'It', 'anal sex', 'food', 'it', 'Ms. Amanchukwu', 'her speech', 'the book', 'it', 'She', 'School districts', 'systems', 'a very clear agenda', 'it', 'impressionable kids', 'adolescents', 'them', 'the bandwagon', 'wokeness', 'Public schools', 'students', 'themselves', 'society', 'They', 'students', 'the lies', 'the left', 'this book', 'a prime example', 'that', 'We', 'you', 'the final statement', 'Ms. Amanchukwu’s speech', '’s', 'a school', 'None']"

She began by disparaging the field of Republican candidates as the ""Seven Dwarfs."" McCaskill then cast Ron DeSantis as ""Snow White,"" because ""he likes white boots."" Are we trying to imply DeSantis is somehow secretly gay, Claire? 





 

McCaskill then took her shot at Donald Trump. Commenting on the report that the Justice Department has informed Trump that he is the target of a federal investigation regarding his handling of classified documents, McCaskill, with mock seriousness, butter not melting in her mouth, invited liberal historian (and occasional Biden speechwriter) Jon Meacham to comment:

""This may be the first time in history—Jon Meacham can speak to this—we have a nominee for president with an ankle bracelet.""

Meacham was on set, but did not offer a reply. When it comes to liberal fantasies of Trump being humiliated by the criminal justice system, McCaskill's dream of the former president in an ankle bracelet is right up there. But it pales in comparison to fired MSNBC host Tiffany Cross's fantasy of Trump being:


""Dragged out on the White House lawn like a 1980s episode of Cops.""


Question: if DeSantis is Snow White, could McCaskill be Old Mother Hubbard? After all, the cupboard of the Missouri electorate was bare for McCaskill. The voters wouldn't throw her a bone.

On Morning Joe, Democrat ex-senator and MSNBC analyst Claire McCaskill fantasizing about Donald Trump in an ankle bracelet, and casting Ron DeSantis as Snow White, was sponsored in part by GlaxoSmithKline, maker of the meningitis B vaccine, Liberty Mutual, Hulu, and Subway.

WILLIE GEIST: So Claire, let's have you put on your prosecutor's hat, if you would. When federal prosecutors tell attorneys for a potential defendant that he is a potential target, that tells you what about their investigation?

CLAIRE MCCASKILL: Tells you they're going to indict him. I'm not aware of many cases where someone has gotten a target letter before the feds had decided that they had the sufficient evidence to go forward.

And, you know, that's the thing about the federal government. They don'thave to do anything until they're ready. It's not like state prosecutors who are doing violent criminals.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Does that mean they're ready? I mean, is that the point of their letter?

MCCASKILL: It means they're ready. It sounds, it looks like to me they're doing something in Florida on a different track --

MIKA: Right.

MCCASKILL: -- having to do with venue, which may be just keeping pressure on witnesses that may be key to an indictment that I believe will come down in Washington.

But it's, it's going to be really interesting and it's going to be interesting politically. We don't know -- so far, charging him with a crime has calcified his support of that 30% of the Republican party.

And now we officially have the Seven Dwarfs in the race, along with DeSantis, who may turn out to be Snow White--he likes white boots. I think Snow White liked white boots.

MIKA: [Snorts] Hmm-mmm.

MCCASKILL: So, this is going to be, this is Trump's dream, that he would have this many Republican candidates in the primary that would siphon off all the anti-Trump voters there are in the Republican party and put him in the, in the driver's seat.

1632,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Socialism Ruins The Environment,"June 8th, 2023 10:15 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/john-stossel/2023/06/08/socialism-ruins-environment,"“Greed of the fossil fuel industry” is “destroying our planet,” says Sen. Bernie Sanders. Young people agree. Their solution? Socialism.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says socialism creates “an environment that provides for all people, not just the privileged few.”

“Nonsense,” says Tom Palmer of the Atlas Network in my new video.

Palmer, unlike Ocasio-Cortez and most of us, spent lots of time in socialist countries. He once smuggled books into the Soviet Union.

What he’s seen convinces him that environmental-movement socialists are wrong about what’s “green.”

“We tried socialism,” says Palmer. “We ran the experiment. It was a catastrophe. Worst environmental record on the planet.”

In China, when socialist leaders noticed that sparrows ate valuable grain, they encouraged people to kill sparrows.

“Billions of birds were killed,” says Palmer.

Government officials shot birds. People without guns banged pans and blew horns, scaring sparrows into staying aloft for longer than they could tolerate.

“These poor exhausted birds fell from the skies,” says Palmer. “It was insanity.”

I pointed out that, watching video of people killing sparrows, it looked like they were happy to do it.

“If you failed to show enthusiasm for the socialist goals of the party,” Palmer responds, “you were going to be in trouble.”

The Party’s campaign succeeded. They killed nearly every sparrow.

But “all it takes is two minutes of thinking to figure, ‘Wait. Who’s going to eat all the bugs?’” says Palmer.

Without sparrows, insects multiplied. Bugs destroyed more crops than the sparrows had.

“People starved as a consequence,” says Palmer. “People confuse socialism with ... a ‘nice government’ or a ‘government that’s sweet’ or ‘made up of my friends.’”

Socialism means central planning. That ends badly.

“What AOC wants to do is basically give the Pentagon, or similar agencies, control over the entire society. She thinks that’s going to turn out well,” says Palmer. “It’s a joke.”

China’s central planners keep making mistakes.

Many Chinese lakes and rivers are bright green. Fertilizer runoff created algae blooms that kill all fish. A Lancet study says Chinese air pollution kills a million people per year.

Wherever socialism is tried, it creates nasty pollution.

In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin wanted cotton for his army. His central planners decided it should be grown near the Aral Sea. They drained so much water that the sea, once the fourth biggest inland lake in the world, shrank to less than half its size.

“Soviet planners caused catastrophic environmental costs to the whole population,” says Palmer.

I push back. “That was then. Now the rules would be different. Now the rule would be: ‘green.’”

“All the time we hear socialists say, ‘Next time, we’ll get it right.’ How many next times do you get?” asks Palmer.

Yet American media still sometimes say socialists protect the environment. A New York Times op-ed claims “Lenin’s eco warriors” created “the world’s largest system of most protected nature reserves.”

“These are not nature preserves,” Palmer responds. “They use it as a dumping ground for heavy metals, for radioactive waste -- in what sense is it a nature preserve?”

Capitalists destroy nature, too. Free societies do need government rules to protect the environment.

But free markets with property rights often protect nature better than bureaucrats can.

Private farmers, explains Palmer, are “concerned about the ability of the farm to grow food next year, year after year, (even) after that farmer is gone. Why? Because the farm has a capital value. That’s the ‘capital’ in capitalism. They want to maximize that.”

Capitalism also protects the environment because it creates wealth. When people aren’t worried about starving or freezing, they get interested in protecting nature. That’s why capitalist countries have cleaner air.

Will Hurd may not be a fan of former President Donald Trump or of culture warring, but unlike most Republicans who appear on MSNBC, he is still says Republican things. That earned him the ire of The 11th Hour host Stephanie Ruhle on Wednesday who angirly told him that he was being “factually incorrect” to urge Republicans to run on issues like fixing inflation, igniting a tense back and forth between the two.

Hurd was on to discuss former Vice President Mike Pence launching his presidential campaign and after claiming Pence is a long shot, urged Republicans focus on non-Trump, non-culture related issues:


Republican voters should be thinking about is if we want to take on Joe Biden and beat him, if we want to do things like secure border, bring back -- bend back inflation, address the debt, then we have to win elections, and that means you got to put somebody up in November who can appeal to independents, and to conservative Democrats, and take advantage of the reality that President Biden's job numbers are so low and that’s the question—


 





 

Ruhle then interrupted for the first of what would be many times, “Hold on, hold on, what did you say about inflation? I couldn’t hear you. You said address the border, you said they should do something about inflation?”

After Hurd repeated himself on reducing inflation, Ruhle claimed “It has been. It has been.”

Hurd made the rather obvious point that it is still not where it needs to be, but Ruhle told him to “hold on please,” but Hurd continued as Ruhle tried to talk over him, “to where it was and where folks would like it, right?”

An agitated Ruhle then accused him of being anti-factual, “Fine! It might not be where folks would like it, but we want to operate in truth here and especially as it relates to the economy.”

Hurd tried to defend himself, but Ruhle wouldn’t let him, “Hold on. It is factually incorrect to say bend backwards in terms of inflation. Because while people might not feel ideal, inflation was running hot last year and it has moved down significantly. So, let's just operate in facts, because if we don't.”

Finally allowed to speak again, Hurd wondered, “are you implying inflation is good right now? That you, you want to keep inflation where it is today, you would like to see that continue for the next four years? Is that what you’re implying?”

Ruhle angrily objected, “I didn’t say that. Sir -- I didn't say that. But what you said to me, a moment ago, would be to bend back. To bend it back means to reverse. It is really important that we are operating in truths, and we are going to continue to do that.”

Far from being anti-fact, Hurd agreed and wondered what Ruhle’s problem was, “Sure, reduce-- reduce it from where it is today.”

No wonder why Biden chose Ruhle for his latest sit down interview.

MSNBC The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle

11:38 PM ET

WILL HURD: And look, Vice President Pence has a narrow margin, but what all of Republican voters should be thinking about is if we want to take on Joe Biden and beat him, if we want to do things like secure border, bring back -- bend back inflation, address the debt, then we have to win elections, and that means you got to put somebody up in November who can appeal to independents, and to conservative Democrats, and take advantage of the reality that President Biden's job numbers are so low and that’s the question—

RUHLE: Hold on, hold on, what did you say about inflation? I couldn’t hear you. You said address the border, you said they should do something about inflation? 

HURD: Yeah, bend it back, bend the curve back on inflation, reduce inflation—

RUHLE: It has been. It has been—

HURD: But it’s not getting back—

RUHLE: Maybe that is one of the reasons-- the hold on please. Hold on please.

HURD: -- to where it was and where folks would like it, right?

RUHLE: Fine! It might not be where folks would like it, but we want to operate in truth here and especially as it relates to the economy –

HURD: Sure, of course., but I'm-- it's —

RUHLE: Hold on. It is factually incorrect to say bend backwards in terms of inflation. Because while people might not feel ideal, inflation was running hot last year and it has moved down significantly. 

HURD: Sure.

RUHLE: So, let's just operate in facts, because if we don't – 

HURD: So, Stephanie, are you implying inflation is good right now? That you, you want to keep inflation where it is today, you would like to see that continue for the next four years? Is that what you’re implying?

RUHLE: I didn’t say that. Sir -- I didn't say that. But what you said to me, a moment ago, would be to bend back. To bend it back means to reverse--

1634,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","‘We Can Save Them Time’: Bozell RIPS Facebook Oversight Board, Preempting Abortion Case Reviews","June 8th, 2023 9:56 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/heather-moon/2023/06/08/we-can-save-them-time-bozell-rips-facebook-oversight,"The Oversight Board for Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta plans to announce three abortion-related posts that have been censored, looking at whether pro-abortion Meta platforms are stifling debate about the issue. But it doesn’t require any scrutiny to know the answer.

The Meta Oversight Board has invited the public to comment on three cases involving the censorship of posts related to abortion discussions in the United States. The announcement claims that this will help it “look at whether Meta’s enforcement practices may be limiting discussion about abortion in the U.S.” The Oversight Board’s invitation to submit comments will close on Thursday, June 29.

MRC President Brent Bozell said no comment period is necessary and that the Oversight Board doesn’t need to review whether Meta’s enforcement practices are limiting discussion on abortion in the U.S. “We can save them time,” said Bozell. “Facebook hates the pro-life movement.”

The 18 documented cases (12 Facebook, 6 Instagram) recorded in MRC Free Speech America’s exclusive CensorTrack database illustrate Bozell’s point. For example, Facebook flagged a video posted by both Alliance Defending Freedom and SBA Pro-Life America that explained a lawsuit filed against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The lawsuit alleged harms caused by common abortion pill drugs. The platform slapped a warning on the post, claiming the post contained “partly false information” and that “Independent fact-checkers say this information has some factual inaccuracies.”

The PolitiFact fact check, written by staff writer Samantha Putterman, relied on the statements of Dr. Daniel Grossman to rebut claims in the lawsuit. But Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, is actively working to expand access to the abortion drugs in question according to pro-life activist group Live Action, an obvious conflict of interest. 

In another case, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and Republican presidential primary candidate Nikki Haley and former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson and his wife Candy posted a screenshot of a Lila Rose tweet criticizing a Colorado abortion law that explicitly allowed abortion up to the moment of birth in April of 2022. Facebook flagged the two posts, applying fact-checks produced from biased fact-checkers Lead Stories and PolitiFact, ultimately reducing the reach and engagement of the posts.

Some of the other prominent cases where Meta platforms have censored pro-life content include when Instagram suspended the account of the Students for Life chapter at Auburn University Oct. 13, 2022, according to purported screenshots. The platform cited its ""Community Guidelines on business integrity,"" but did not explain how the account violated this rule. 

Both Facebook and Instagram also censored a post by MRC quoting then-HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson on Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger’s racist views. The two Meta platforms applied a PolitiFact fact-check to claim that the MRC post was “missing context,” but the fact-check applied to the MRC post was from 2015 and appeared to be referencing an entirely different Ben Carson quote. 

In another outrageous case of censorship, Instagram found the iconic 1999 image of an in-utero baby’s fingers holding the fingers of the surgeon saving its life to be “sensitive content.” Instagram placed a sensitive content filter over the image, requiring users to click a small link in order to view the image.

There’s really no doubt about where Meta stands on the abortion issue, and it's completely ridiculous for the Oversight Board to treat the matter like it’s still an open question.

Among the other events that Nike will host are a panel discussion with a gender-reassignment surgery specialist, and a showing of a movie titled “Change The Game” which will push transgender athletes. In addition, they will donate $600,000 to different LGBT-friendly organizations.

Why Nike feels the need to play the role of ambassador for a demographic that wants to mutilate children and have men compete against women is beyond me.

1636,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",MSNBC Segment Falsely Claims Parent Organizations Are Hate Groups,"June 7th, 2023 11:23 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/cassandra-devries/2023/06/07/msnbc-deems-parent-organizations-hate-groups,"MSNBC's Deadline: White House, one of the network's top-rated shows, fully leaned into its divisive view of conservatives Tuesday by touting as fact a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) which proclaimed without evidence that parental rights groups are hate groups.
Host Nicolle Wallace huffed through multiple readings of the report, calling parents concerned about racially divisive and sexually explicit content presented to young children as “reactionary anti-student inclusion groups” and akin to January 6 rioters. She added at another point that such groups and women speaking out against biological men in sports as “target[ing],” “malign[ing] and threaten[ing] kids.”

 






For good measure, the head of SPLC added her own thoughts about these “terrifying individuals” while former FBI official and MSNBC contributor Frank Figliuzzi called parental rights and female sports advocates reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

The SPLC’s report attacked Mom’s for Liberty and Parents Defending Education, coalitions of parents seeking to review their children’s education, and referred to them as anti-government, extremist, inciters of domestic violence, and a hate group. Host Nicolle Wallace said the report was “rooted on research and data” and portrayed its contents as fact, including this excerpt.


Reactionary anti-student inclusion groups such as Moms for Liberty, Moms for America, Parents Defending Education that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as extremist groups are, by their very nature, responding to social progress that they dislike and have no control over. Like many other hard-right groups, these reactionary anti-student inclusion groups are constantly painting themselves as an oppressed class, while vilifying those discriminated against.


Wallace welcomed SPLC President and CEO Margret Huang as a hero for her work on the report. Huang rebuked Moms for Liberty for, “pushing to ban certain books, ban curricula, punish teachers who talk about inclusive education, and generally make our school boards miserable in seeking to provide an inclusive education for all.” She described their efforts as “terrifying” to children and “detrimental to their well-being.” As she spoke, the headline “Breaking News; Report: Schools Are Primary Target for Locally Driven Extremist Mobilization” ran across the screen.

 MSNBC continued their portrayal of concerned parents as hate-filled extremists by describing the alleged harm these groups caused students. Wallace read from the SPLC’s report that, “The fear and pain experienced by Black, brown, and LGBTQ communities went far beyond any individual incident, deeply disrupting their ability to participate in an inclusive democracy.”

Frank Figliuzzi even compared groups on SPLC’s hate list to the KKK. He claimed that these groups adopted the KKK’s tactics to infiltrate schools and force their hate-filled agenda on unsuspecting citizens. He said:


But I harken back to decades ago when the FBI and DOJ really aggressively targeted and successfully went after criminally the KKK. And what happened there was they took off their hoods and their sheets, they put on suits and ties, they went local, and they ran for office. So, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen this going local mainstreaming of hatred. We’ve seen it before. And we see it now with people who truly are driven by hate and deception running for school board and elective office.


Figliuzzi rejected parents’ concern about the curriculum, viewing such attempts at influence as manipulative tactics to promote hate.

“Activists have made a concerted effort to organize in the local arena, pursuing their agenda in venues where it is easier to gain power.” Wallace read from the report. “In 2022, the hard-right movement succeeded in burrowing deeper in peoples’ lives in visible and material ways, even if it did not have widespread electoral success. Its fingerprints are everywhere: people’s homes, schools, doctors’ offices, libraries, bars, restaurants, churches, and other community spaces.”

At no point did MSNBC offer a counterpoint to Huang and its panel’s accusations against conservative parental groups. Instead, they presented the SPLC’s harsh accusations as objective and factual.

Among the issues asked was whether Pence would let parents get their children sex change surgeries in the name of parental rights. 

“I want to ask you about another issue related to this, and that is about what's going on in some legislatures,” Bash started off asking. “Some Republican-controlled states have banned transgender children from receiving gender-affirming care, even with the consent of their parents.”

 





 

“You talk a lot about parents' rights. You do it on the campaign trail,” Bash said in an attempt to make Pence look hypocritical. “So why do you believe it's the government's role to overrule what parents decide is best for their own children in this case?”

“I strongly support state legislation, including as we did in Indiana, that bans all gender transition chemical or surgical procedures for kids under the age of 18,” Pence responded. 

Bash interjected to ask: “what if their parents support that?” 

“There is a reason why you don't let kids get a tattoo before they're 18,” Pence correctly noted. 

Attempting to be obnoxious and difficult, Bash huffed: “I don't think the government regulates tattoos.”

Pence immediately shut her down: “When you're talking about something that is absolutely transformational, and that we know from mental health experts more often than not has profound negative deleterious effects on people in the long-term.""

""I think at minimum, it is proper for state governments and state officials to simply say, whatever, however adults want to live, they can live, but for children, we're going to protect kids from the radical gender ideology and say no chemical or surgical gender transition before you're 18,"" Pence added. 

Pence is far too kind to Bash in his answers. The proper response to her question is that it's not tolerant or helpful to children suffering from gender dysphoria to go agree with them that they are the opposite sex. They need proper psychological treatment to help them get through their issues. 

Affirming a child who claims to be the opposite sex is no different than agreeing with an anorexic child when they tell you that they're fat.

DANA BASH: Sir, I want to ask you about another issue related to this, and that is about what's going on in some legislatures. Some Republican-controlled states have banned transgender children from receiving gender-affirming care, even with the consent of their parents. You talk a lot about parents' rights. You do it on the campaign trail. 

MIKE PENCE: I do. 

BASH: You've done it before. You just did it now. So why do you believe it's the government's role to overrule what parents decide is best for their own children in this case? 

PENCE: Well, I strongly support state legislation, including as we did in Indiana that bans all gender transition chemical or surgical procedures for kids under the age of 18. 

BASH: So what if their parents support that? 

PENCE: I hear you. I hear you. But on this one, I got to tell you, Dana, and I'm talking as a father, and I'm talking as a grandfather right now, look, there is a reason why you don't let kids get a tattoo before they're 18, right. Because those of us that have been parents know that before they're 18, I don't want to say anything. My kids are watching. But, you know. They think you're an idiot for everything. 

BASH: But, I don't think the government regulates tattoos. 

PENCE: Look, I'm just telling you.

“If you woke up this morning and your lungs were burning, you had a hard time breathing, or you looked up in the sky and felt as though you were in an apocalyptic doomsday movie, you were not alone,” Reid said, closing out her show. 

“Right now, more than 400 wildfires are burning across Canada, which is experiencing its worst wildfire season in history. And that smoke is billowing its way all across the United States,” she added. 

 





 

According to Reid, “these kinds of weather phenomena are happening all around the globe and it's only becoming more and more common, all because of climate change.”

She then parroted a leftist lie about a “climate catastrophe” and screeched that “many world leaders are still wary of any substantial climate action because of their unrelenting dependence on oil.” 

Continuing to fearmonger about so-called “climate change,” Reid huffed: “As long as we stay addicted, they will not only get richer and gobble up more and more of our industries and our culture, we will suffer the consequences, as the planet we live on, and that our children and grandchildren will inherit, becomes even more dangerous to live in.”

“You’d think it’d be a priority to keep breathing,” she sneered. 

She failed to explain how using oil to fuel our industrial economy contributes to wildfires. There have been wildfires for thousands of years, long before oil and other fossil fuels came into widespread use.

MSNBC’s The ReidOut
6/7/2023
7:58:17 p.m. Eastern

JOY REID: If you woke up this morning and your lungs were burning, you had a hard time breathing, or you looked up in the sky and felt as though you were in an apocalyptic doomsday movie, you were not alone. Right now, more than 400 wildfires are burning across Canada, which is experiencing its worst wildfire season in history. And that smoke is billowing its way all across the United States. Today, around 98 million people across 18 states from New Hampshire all the way to South Carolina were under air quality alerts. Including New York City, which earlier today, had the worst air quality in the world. The air was so bad, officials in the affected areas are urging people to stay inside, not partake in any outdoor activity, and start wearing N95 masks again. 

These kinds of weather phenomena are happening all around the globe and it's only becoming more and more common, all because of climate change. And even as we barrel towards a climate catastrophe, many world leaders are still wary of any substantial climate action because of their unrelenting dependence on oil. And among the world's top oil suppliers is Canada, as well as the U.S. And, of course, there’s Saudi Arabia. Their massive oil supply has made them one of the richest nations in the world. The Saudis are so rich off oil, they're actually buying up parts of the U.S., buildings, businesses, and now apparently golf. As the PGA just announced their merger with Saudi Arabia's LIV golf franchise.

All of this, despite the fact that their government played a role in funding the September 11th terrorist attacks, as well as brutally murdering Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and hacking up his body with a bone saw. These are the people who are eating off our addiction to oil. And as long as we stay addicted, they will not only get richer and gobble up more and more of our industries and our culture, we will suffer the consequences, as the planet we live on, and that our children and grandchildren will inherit, becomes even more dangerous to live in.

Managing Editor Curtis Houck joins the show as we discuss the short-lived Licht Era, which is overstating what happened over the last 13 months.

Curtis looked at several written pieces that underlined what happened -- first, the massive 15,000-word piece by Tim Alberta for The Atlantic, which the reporters at Puck News painted as a disaster, and then a New York Times piece by Benjamin Mullin that underlined how current CNN employees used Zucker as a ""grievance switchboard.""

He simultaneously faulted the American people for having negative ideas about the Biden economy.

Scarborough brought in MSNBC’s economic analyst Steve Rattner to show his audience the charts and data to try and explain the phenomenon liberal media hacks just couldn’t understand: people did not approve of President Biden’s handling of the US economy.





The fact that Rattner’s chart contrasting President Trump’s and President Biden’s rating on the “Misery Index” and Consumer Sentiment Index clearly favored Trump needed a wild idea to explain. And Scarborough brought it, whining that the media (including MSNBC) bought unto Trump’s narrative that the economy was good (Click “expand”):


“Because it was always, it was always so interesting that Donald Trump ran around every day talking about the greatest economy ever, I've got the greatest economy ever, I've got the greatest economy ever, and actually people not just on Fox News, people on this network would begin their questions by going, well, of course Donald Trump has the best economy in history or whatever. It’s like that got into the bloodstream of not just people around trump, but, you know, journalists who he said it so much, they started believing it. I just want to throw a little bit of reality on to this …

So he [Trump] really didn't have a strong economy if you are measuring it actually by other presidents. And yet you look at that consumer confidence and people just assume Trump had a great economy because Trump kept saying I have a great economy.”


So, according to Scarborough, the economic prosperity under Trump that polls show the majority of people agree was real, was actually not. It was all just an illusion they made up in their minds because they were mindless morons who believed whatever Trump said. It definitely was not because of, as Rattner admitted:

“He [Trump] also did have low inflation and low unemployment, I take your point about his relative performance to the other presidents.”

It is shocking that Scarborough could not figure out that having low unemployment and inflation- the two data points that make up the Misery Index he was just shown- could lead to people having a positive view of the Trump economy.

Finally, Scarborough’s rank leftism inevitably led him to blame not Biden, but everyday Americans for pessimistic views on Biden’s economy. Scarborough zeroed in on one statistic that roughly 73 percent of Americans were positive about their current personal finances, ignoring the possibility that they could actually have that good number because of Trump’s economy. He complained about “all the bitching and whining” from the right and then leveled the accusation that American consumers have a “massive disconnect” where they should love Biden’s economy despite the inflation. He also scolded younger economists and reporters for fretting the runaway inflation under Biden. “And it is, it’s been for a lot of people, younger people for the media as well who don't remember 1979, 1980, 1981 when interest rates were shooting up into the high teens,” he lectured.

Rattner also got into the game of blaming the media for giving the public the “very negative perceptions of what they are seeing in the media about inflation and obviously that also effects public opinion.” Adding that it was “simply a perception that the job situation is not nearly as good as it is, frankly, and as at least some people are reporting it.”

Meanwhile, MSNBC’s sister network, NBC, recently ran a story how the Biden economy was so bad it was destroying job offers for college grads.

MSNBC’s Morning Joe

06/07/23

7:32 AM ET

(…)

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let's go to the big board though first, let’s go to Steve Rattner. Hey Steve, you know I asked last week about you know all of these positive economic signs. You had yet another chart yesterday talking about investment in manufacturing in the United States. Just exploding in ways that are really heartening. And yet there’s this dichotomy, there’s a dichotomy between what the economic numbers are showing and how Americans are feeling. You've got some charts to explain why. Tell us about it. 


STEVE RATTNER: Yeah, Joe, it’s a question you and I have talked about fairly often and fairly regularly. You've asked me a few times. I don't know that I have a perfect answer, but let me show you some numbers that may at least help everybody who’s on the show at the moment, help answer this question. 

So, let's start over here and talk about how bad people feel at the moment. First of all, it’s interesting that the country has been on a wrong track going all the way back really to after the 9/11 moment subsided. But you've had this very, very steadily negative feeling among Americans about right track, wrong track. You can see on optimism about the economy notwithstanding what you just mentioned and a lot of other positive data, steeply, still deeply in negative territory. You can see consumer sentiment notwithstanding again good news, deeply in negative territory. 

And not surprisingly when you look at presidential approval ratings, you can see that President Biden is unfortunately in deeply negative territory after having had a good start to his presidency. Even Obama had a fairly mixed up and down but some positive times -- in positive territory. 

So let's look at a, try to look at a correlation between some economic conditions and how people feel. So if you look down here, this is what we call the misery index. This is the combination going back in the '70s during a terrible time in the country of course, combination of unemployment plus inflation added up. And so you can see way back in May 1980, the misery index was in really bad shape. But then if you look at that against consumer sentiment, and you draw a line, do a statistical analysis, you draw a line and say what is the correlation between these two, the correlation is quite high. 

And you can see that even President Trump in each of these dots represents a month, even President Trump essentially hugged that line. President Biden on the other hand, his numbers have come in way below that line. And in other words consumer sentiment is far worse than what would be suggested by Biden's actual performance in terms of unemployment plus inflation. 


SCARBOROUGH: You know, and, Steve, let me interrupt you here, too. Because it was always, it was always so interesting that Donald Trump ran around every day talking about the greatest economy ever, I've got the greatest economy ever, I've got the greatest economy ever” And actually people not just on Fox News, people on this network would begin their questions by going, well, of course Donald Trump has the best economy in history or whatever. 

It’s like that got into the bloodstream of not just people around Trump, but, you know, journalists who he said it so much, they started believing it. I just want to throw a little bit of reality on to this. 

Even before COVID, we could talk about the thing that matters so much to me and that is the debt, just record setting debts, the biggest budget busting budgets ever, the biggest deficits ever. But even beyond debt, even with all the spending, even with all the tax cuts, post-World War II, he ranked seventh in GDP growth behind Jimmy Carter even, behind Jimmy Carter and I think Gerald Ford and several others. Even before COVID. 

So, he really didn't have a strong economy if you are measuring it actually by other presidents. And yet, you look at that consumer confidence and people just assume Trump had a great economy because Trump kept saying I have a great economy. 

RATTNER: So that may be simply a question of salesmanship, presidential leadership, whatever you want to call it. But yeah, Trump convinced people he had very high consumer sentiment numbers. He also did have low inflation and low unemployment. I take your point about his relative performance to the other presidents. 

But Biden also has a good economy at the moment. We have 3.7 percent unemployment. Yes, we have some inflation, but I'll show you numbers on incomes and things still doing well. And yet he has not been able to -- or people have not responded to it by having a reasonable amount of positive attitude toward the economy. And consumer sentiment is down here in the toilet back in June ‘22, it was as bad as it was in May '80 even though the economy was obviously vastly better than it was in May '80. 

SCARBOROUGH: Yeah, okay, so let's go to the next chart about inflation and the impact on the national outlook. 

RATTNER: So, let's start with a point you sort of made there, which was people actually are in pretty good economic situations and they actually think that they are in pretty good economic situations. Seventy-three percent of Americans think their personal finances are either good or very good. That’s a big number. But when you ask them about communities, only 39% say their communities are good or very good in terms of…

SCARBOROUGH: Steve, hold on, I’ve gotta stop you. You just said something that I know is surprising to a lot of people that are watching the show right now. Three out of four Americans, we hear all the bitching and all the whining about how bad the economy is from the right, the Trump right. Three out of four Americans think their economic situation is either good or very good. I mean, this would suggest again a massive disconnect. Not from what Joe Biden’s saying but what Americans are saying about their own good economic situation. 

RATTNER: They are saying that, Joe, that's exactly right. They’re also saying that their communities they think only 40 percent good or excellent. They’re saying in the country, only 18 percent good or excellent. And if you ask people where do you think you’re gonna be a year from now, they’re actually not that optimistic, they’re actually more pessimistic than optimism. So, it’s a very odd set of personal feelings. 

One possible explanation for all of this is inflation. People hate inflation. It is one of the, that’s why it is in the misery index. But you can see nonetheless that under Joe Biden, the consumer pricing index has gone up by 15.3 percent. Personal incomes have gone up by 19.2 percent. Meaning that people have still stayed ahead of inflation as a whole. But at that said, there are a number of categories, a lot of sensitive things that people buy often or at least are very exposed to the prices of, that have gone up by much, much higher numbers. Food, cars, energy, and this is automobiles here. 

And so, on one hand their incomes if you -- as an economist would look at it, have gone up after inflation, but they are still feeling a lot of the effects of inflation and I think a lot of the pundits so to speak would say that this is a part of why the other numbers I showed you before look so bad. 

SCARBOROUGH: Yeah, I talked before about how people in the media were going “well, of course, yes, Donald Trump's economy is the best” just because he kept saying it, but media negativity also has had a big impact on Biden as well and it’s pulled him down.  

Just a side comment here, Steve, most people in the media, they don't remember -- well, they never reported on inflation. This was a shock for a lot of economists who had never dealt with inflation in their adult life. This was a shock for politicians who have never had to go around and knock on doors and explain what’s happening with inflation. And it is, it’s been for a lot of people, younger people for the media as well who don't remember 1979, 1980, 1981 when interest rates were shooting up into the high teens. 

RATTNER: So, to your point about that, Joe, there is evidence that media certainly affects people's views. And that’s what these charts here show.

And so this basically asks the question of the news I see about inflation, is mostly blank. Positive,  negative. And so you can see if you look at their sentiment and you compare it to what is actually happening, you can, obviously, see a big correlation. When inflation spiked up, there was a negative feeling toward inflation. Inflation becomes fairly benign, still a little bit negative, but pretty benign. And then the spike in inflation again, obviously, very negative perceptions of what they’re seeing in the media about inflation and obviously that also affects public opinion.

But here’s, that’s not surprising. That’s probably what you would have expected. But here is something that I think that is surprising, which is if you do the same exact analysis for unemployment, and jobs, you can see the news I see about employment is mostly -- and back there it was very negative. We had the great jobs explosion here in the 2000s, up to and including COVID, obviously you have COVID, but then the jobs numbers start to recover and they get all the way back to where they were here, but the negativity doesn't recover.

In fact, it turns negative. It was positive before COVID, it went negative even though the jobs numbers are so good, and it has stayed negative. Why is that? A couple possible explanations. Of course, none of us never really know the answer. One is that there is more talk about layoffs at the moment and that may well be having an effect on people's psyches. But beyond that, it’s simply a perception that the job situation is not nearly as good as it is, frankly, and as at least some people are reporting it.

CBS, like most of the left-wing media ecosystem, were no strangers to pushing the left’s transgender ideology, but to highlight this in such a transparent way was something very different.

Anchor Norah O’Donnell kicked off the segment whining about the “wave of anti-transgender legislation being passed in Republican-led states.” Pointing out that “Missouri became the 20th state this year to pass laws aimed at limiting transgender rights.”

O’Donnell then used the Owellian language of the left by calling procedures like puberty blockers “gender-affirming care.” 

“Arkansas was the first to enact a ban on gender-affirming care for young people,” she insisted. 

 





 

Then correspondent Janet Shamlian took over to paint a rosy picture of child abuse: “There’s a lot of laughs among the five Garbett children at their Little Rock home. But Lizz Garbett, an operating room nurse, says before her son Simon transitioned a few years ago, it was very different.” 

The mother of the girl who now claims to be a boy told CBS that “we couldn't figure out what was going on. And it was not a happy place. And after he transitioned, our home got calm again. Everybody felt like themselves.”

“The now 17-year-old first transitioned socially, cutting his hair, changing clothing. And has since legally changed his name. Started hormone replacement therapy, and became an activist for the rights of trans youth,” Shamlian gushed. 

Shamlian reported that “half of transgender and nonbinary young people considered attempting suicide in the past year. Arkansas has passed eight laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ people in 2023.” 

After interviewing Arkansas Republican state representative Mary Bentley who sponsored the law, Bentley told Shamlian that transgender surgeries were “not decreasing suicide, in fact, these cross-sex hormones are increasing the stress that folks go through.”

“But at least 30 national medical organizations disagree, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which says a majority of patients report improved mental health and suicide rates decrease after receiving gender-affirming care,” Shamlian falsely claimed.

NORAH O’DONNELL: In addition to anti-LGBTQ+ protests and boycotts, we’ve also seen a wave of anti-transgender legislation being passed in Republican-led states. Today, Missouri became the 20th state this year to pass laws aimed at limiting transgender rights. Arkansas was the first to enact a ban on gender-affirming care for young people. That law has been temporarily blocked by a judge. CBS's Janet Shamlian goes in-depth tonight on the impact these restrictions can have on many families. 

JANET SHAMLIAN: There’s a lot of laughs among the five Garbett children at their Little Rock home. But Lizz Garbett, an operating room nurse, says before her son Simon transitioned a few years ago, it was very different. 

LIZZ GARBETT: We couldn't figure out what was going on. And it was not a happy place. And after he transitioned, our home got calm again. Everybody felt like themselves. And I have been able to watch him, like, blossom into his true self. 

SHAMLIAN: The now 17-year-old first transitioned socially, cutting his hair, changing clothing. And has since legally changed his name. Started hormone replacement therapy, and became an activist for the rights of trans youth. 

What’s it like to put yourself out there? 

SIMON GARBETT: It -- it's nerve-racking, and it's scary, and it gives me a lot of anxiety. But I have to do it. I would feel worse if I didn't. 

SHAMLIAN: Half of transgender and nonbinary young people considered attempting suicide in the past year. Arkansas has passed eight laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ people in 2023. Republican state representative Mary Bentley sponsored some of that legislation. 

Is this in any way a message to transgender youth and/or their families that you don't want them in Arkansas? 

REP. MARY BENTLEY (R-AR): Not at all. We care. This gender-affirming care is not decreasing suicide, in fact, these cross-sex hormones are increasing the stress that folks go through. 

SHAMLIAN: But at least 30 national medical organizations disagree, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, which says a majority of patients report improved mental health and suicide rates decrease after receiving gender-affirming care. 

How did your happiness change from before to after? 

SIMON GARBETT: Before, I was...Suicidal. I was miserable. 

LIZZ GARBETT: My kid is trans, but that’s just a tiny little piece of who he is. And he just wants to be allowed to live his real, authentic self.

1642,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",‘Most Damning’ About FBI: New Twitter Files Expose FBI-Ukraine Plot to Censor Users,"June 7th, 2023 6:52 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/catherine-salgado/2023/06/07/most-damning-about-fbi-new-twitter-files-expose-fbi,"The latest Twitter Files suggest the FBI helped Ukrainian intelligence in an effort to encourage Twitter to censor users, even American journalists.

The Grayzone News host Aaron Maté unleashed the latest installment of The Twitter Files on June 7 in a thread that Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi called “perhaps the most damning about the FBI.” Maté reported the evidence, both on Twitter and Substack: “The FBI aided a Ukrainian intelligence effort to ban Twitter users and collect their data, leaks reveal. Twitter declined to censor journalists targeted by Ukraine, including Aaron Maté.” This newly released evidence once again implicates the U.S. government in an anti-free speech censorship plot, this time in reported coordination with a foreign government.

According to The Twitter Files, FBI Special Agent Aleksandr Kobzanets sent a list of 163 accounts to Twitter in March 2022. The agent did so on behalf of “Ukraine’s main intelligence agency,” SBU, with the following comment: “These accounts are suspected by the SBU in spreading fear and disinformation.” The now-infamous FBI Special Agent Elvis Chan was copied on the email according to a screenshot shared by Maté.

The email, which included an attached SBU memo, listed accounts that SBU accused of being “used to disseminate disinformation and fake news to inaccurately reflect events in Ukraine.” The accounts, SBU claimed, also justified alleged “war crimes” and a “violation of international law.” The screenshots from Maté showed SBU requesting Twitter “to stop Russian aggression on the information front” by choosing “to block these Twitter accounts and provide us with user data.” The user data SBU wanted would have included phone numbers and dates of birth, per Maté’s Substack.

Maté explained that “The Ukrainian government’s FBI-enabled list of accounts marked for censorship extends to members of the media.” His name and Twitter profile appeared alongside Russian journalists’.  

According to Twitter’s response through Yoel Roth, Twitter told the FBI it would review the targeted accounts, Maté noted. Roth, however, voiced concerns about SBU’s inclusion of Canadian and American journalists, including Maté’s name. He was open to being convinced, though.

The FBI dismissed its censorship request as “assistance to Ukraine,” Maté tweeted. But he has a different interpretation, tweeting, the “FBI’s attempt to ban Twitter accounts at the request of Ukrainian intelligence is among the most overt requests for censorship” yet uncovered by The Twitter Files.

The FBI would not answer his question about the above censorship, Maté wrote in a tweet. It merely replied, “While we appreciate your inquiry, as a matter of practice we do not confirm, deny, or otherwise comment on specific interactions nor confirm the veracity of correspondence.”

1643,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","CNN Claims Fewer Deaths, Less Racism with Electric Cars","June 7th, 2023 6:50 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/ana-schau/2023/06/07/cnn-claims-fewer-deaths-less-racism-electric-cars,"CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir made an appearance on Wednesday’s CNN News Central to condemn gas-powered vehicles and to sing the praises of electric ones, which apparently can save lives, according to a study by the American Lung Association. Weir also cited the study’s claims that an all-electric vehicle base would reduce things like asthma attacks, “lost work days,” and health costs, as well as claiming that it would right the “unjust” racism here, because pollution “really, really affects communities of color.”

Weir began his pitch by citing the study and explaining its findings. It claimed that, if the nation goes electric by 2050, there will be “89,300 fewer premature deaths” from air pollution. It also said that there will have been “2.2 million fewer asthma attacks,” as well as “10.7 million fewer lost workdays” and “$978 billion in public health benefits” as the result of the “cleaner air.”

Of course, these numbers were mostly fabricated from conjectures based loosely on past data points and the political agenda of those who recorded and reported them.

 





 

One thing that the study did get right was the fact that transportation produces the greatest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, at 28 percent, but the reliance on facts ended there. The study also omitted details such as electricity coming as a close second in greenhouse gas emissions, at 25 percent (which would only increase with the use of more electric cars), and the fact that 80 percent of electricity comes from non-renewable sources, especially fossil fuels and coal.

The American Lung Association itself acknowledged that power plants “emit harmful pollutants” when generating electricity. However, this only prompted them to encourage more renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind power, which require more facilities and money to produce the same amount of energy. In addition to this, many government-run initiatives to create more solar farms or wind turbines are opposed by locals for many reasons, including the reduction of their property’s value and the preservation of the area’s natural beauty and wildlife.

Weir then cited the study’s claims that “the burdens of unhealthy air” affected “communities of color disproportionately,” since apparently they often lived “next to highways and power plants,” and thus were “64 percent more likely than a white person to live in a community impacted by unhealthy air and 3.7 times more likely to live with the most polluted air in the United States.”

Essentially, Weir was claiming that American pollution was racist too, specifically targeting those “communities of color” in an “unjust” way. Of course, there was no mention of how the process to obtain the minerals needed to make the batteries for electric cars was damaging to the environment, like the cobalt mine Hunter Biden helped China purchase in Africa.

SARA SNIDER: All right. A new study claims that a move to electric cars is not only good for the environment, it’s also good for our health. The American Lung Association says that if everyone were to switch to zero-emissions vehicles here in the United States, the nation would see nearly 90,000 fewer premature deaths by 2050.

CNN's Bill Weir is joining us now. How did the—the American Lung Association actually come up with the—the 90,000 people number?

BILL WEIR: Well, Sara, you know, while we focus easily on the heat-trapping pollutions, carbon dioxide, methane, natural gas, that’s heating up the planet, the American Lung Association has this really long data set on stuff that gets into our bodies, and our lungs. And they, they ran modeling looking at the emission standards of our current fleet to what it would be if we were to electrify in the United States by 2035.

And it’s a pretty stunning thing, just by eliminating the kind of pollution that comes out of tailpipes and dirty fuel power plants would save over 80,000 lives, almost 90,000 lives. It would prevent 2.2 million asthma attacks ov—by 2050. It would save almost 11 million lost work days, overall, and save the economy close to a trillion dollars in health savings. This has been the case of a lot of academics, who says that just getting off of fossil fuels, the health benefits would pay for the cost of transitioning there as well.

This doesn't take into account, interestingly enough, the impact of wildfire smoke. More wildfires, a product of a—of a heating planet. In New York City, we just hit an air quality index of 351, anything over 350 is Code Red for everybody, so there's that concern, but this looks at just cleaning up the fleet of vehicles of the United States, but there’s a long way to go, Sara.

Less than five percent of cars sold are—are electric these days. It's huge—it’s about to uncork. There's huge pent-up demand, there’s huge incentives now in the Inflation Reduction Act.

But this also affects folks—communities of color disproportionately around the country, so the American Lung Association trying to say this is unjust, our choice of fuels not only warms things up for everybody, but really, really affects communities of color living next to highways and power plants.

1644,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",MSNBC Ignores Soros Connection to Extremist Group Smearing Moms as Bigots,"June 7th, 2023 5:42 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/tom-olohan/2023/06/07/msnbc-ignores-soros-connection-extremist-group-smearing-moms,"A group funded by radical billionaire George Soros is smearing a group of concerned mothers as being somehow filled with hate and MSNBC was just tickled pink over it.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) repeated on Tuesday its pathetic tradition of smearing groups that speak out against the left's preferred narrative by placing the pro-parent education group Moms for Liberty on the same “hate map” as violent and racist groups, such as neo-Nazis and the Klu Klux Klan. MSNBC’s host Nicole Wallace invited SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang on to the June 6 edition of Deadline: White House where Huang and Wallace both spewed propaganda at Moms for Liberty. Wallace referred to Moms for Liberty as “reactionary,” while Huang called them “right wing-ideologues.” But what was missing from MSNBC’s coverage was any mention that the leftist SPLC was connected to Soros, who has a sordid history of supporting anti-family initiatives. 





The Soros-funded SPLC website claims that Moms for Liberty “spread[s] hateful imagery and rhetoric against the LGBTQ community.” The SPLC engages in guilt by association to smear Moms for Liberty, while downplaying the insane leftist political agendas the group opposes, such as critical race theory and radicalized gender ideological indoctrination of children. Soros’ Open Society Foundations gave SPLC a $75,000 grant in 2016, while Foundation Directory Online data suggest the Soros Fund Charitable Foundation gave another $90,000 between 2017 and 2019, totaling $160,000 in funding collectively between the two Soros groups.

The SPLC being anti-parent and anti-family falls right in line with Soros’ distorted vision of open society. Soros doesn’t mince words about the insane “open society” world he envisions when taken to its logical conclusion: “[I]n a perfectly open society none of the existing ties are final, and people’s relation to nation, family, and their fellows depends entirely on their own decisions.” What his absurd vision means, however, is that “the permanence of social relationships has disappeared; the organic structure of society has disintegrated to the point where its atoms, the individuals, float around without any roots,” Soros wrote in Underwriting Democracy. 

But that’s not all. Soros-funded global media outlet openDemocracy published an op-ed from a “queer communism” activist who said the COVID-19 crisis “shows it’s time to abolish the [nuclear] family.” Specifically, according to that article, “the pandemic is an acutely important time to provision, evacuate and generally empower survivors of — and refugees from — the nuclear household.” Soros fueled at least $1,633,457 into openDemocracy between 2016 and 2020 alone.

SPLC appears to be helping to further Soros’ vision. 

Moms for Liberty responded to the SPLC on twitter, calling their inclusion on the “hate map” part of a “coordinated attempt to silence and suppress us.” SPLC is in no position to be throwing the word “hate” around. Recently, SPLC attorney Thomas Webb Jurgens was charged with domestic terrorism after being arrested at an event where protestors threw Molotov cocktails at a law enforcement training facility in Georgia, according to the New York Post. SPLC, of course, downplayed the arrest by claiming they will continue to push back against “violence and police use of force against Black, Brown and Indigenous communities.” Wallace didn’t bother bringing this scandal up while it propped up the SPLC’s smear campaign.

Twitter revolted against the Soros-tied SPLC for targeting mothers.

Among those defending Moms for Liberty were Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Christopher Rufo, who tweeted, “The SPLC is a left-wing activist organization that manipulates historical guilt in order to smear its political opponents. The women who lead Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education are good-hearted patriots who should file suit against the SPLC.” 

Echoing Rufo’s defense, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) called the SPLC “a corrupt slush fund devoted to defamation.” Christina Pushaw, the Rapid Response Director for Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign, responded to the news by tweeting: “Unreal that being a mom who cares about her kids’ education and well-being is now considered ‘hate.’ I think the real hate group here is SPLC!”

Past smear campaigns by the SPLC have not ended well, which apparently didn’t faze MSNBC. In 2012, a man shot a guard and attempted to murder employees of the Family Research Council (FRC) and smear Chick-fil-A sandwiches on their faces, reportedly after finding the group on the SPLC “hate map.” 

FRC President Tony Perkins said that this unhinged man “was given a license to perpetrate this act of violence by groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center which has systematically and recklessly labeled every organization with which they disagree as a 'hate group.'” Wallace also conveniently ignored mentioning this incident too.

Conservatives are under attack.

1645,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",The Revolution at the Heart of ‘Pride’,"June 7th, 2023 5:14 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/ben-shapiro/2023/06/07/revolution-heart-pride,"June 1 marked the advent of Pride Month -- the most important sacrament of the American secular religious calendar. During Pride Month, public schools across the nation teach small children the joys of alternative sexual practices and orientations; corporations plaster their stores in rainbow accoutrements of all sorts; and the federal government of the United States proclaims its fidelity to the LGBTQ+*&^% ideology.

The American public, for the most part, has historically taken Pride Month not for what it is but for what it sometimes purports to be: a call for tolerance of the marginalized. But that, of course, is not what Pride Month is or ever was. Pride Month is not a call for equality but a call for revolution. The Pride movement was always a call for a replacement of historic, tried and true cultural norms with new, untried and risky cultural norms.

Heteronormativity is one such tried and true norm: the correct belief that any durable society rests on the basis of male-female dyads producing children. Such a norm ought to be promoted. But Pride suggests the opposite: that heteronormativity is an authoritarian and discriminatory standard that places artificial limits on the full flowering of human sexuality. Explode the norm and maximize human happiness!

This, of course, was precisely the case made by the original exponents of the sexual revolution. Herbert Marcuse, author of “Eros and Civilization” (1955) called for a rewriting of all sexual norms in order to tear down the capitalist structure. He sought “a non-repressive civilization, based on a fundamentally different experience of being, a fundamentally different relation between man and nature, and fundamentally different existential relations.” Such a civilization could only be birthed by treating “the body in its entirety (as) an object of cathexis, a thing to be enjoyed -- an instrument of pleasure.” Sex would be unmoored from marriage and parenthood; Marcuse argued, “the barriers against absolute gratification would become elements of human freedom... This sensuous rationality contains its own moral laws.”

By 1970, feminist Shulamith Firestone argued that sexual revolution would bring about “not just the elimination of male privilege but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally.” Happiness would now be found in a “reversion to an unobstructed pansexuality -- Freud’s ‘polymorphous perversity’ -- would probably supersede hetero/homo/bi-sexuality.”

We have now reached the dystopia sought by Marcuse and Firestone: a world in which all the elites in our society participate in the rewriting of durable societal norms in favor of unending sexual gratification. In order to maintain that dystopia, however, our societal elites require one more element: repression of the traditional norms. A fair fight might leave traditional Judeo-Christian norms in place; they’ve proved rather durable over time. Marcuse had a solution for just such a problem: repression. Promotion of the new morality would require quashing the old. “(L)iberation of the Damned of the Earth presupposes suppression not only of their old but also of their new masters,” Marcuse wrote.

And so the culture war rages. Because, after all, old norms don’t die easily. They must be killed in order to achieve “Pride” in the alternative. And that revolution requires the exercise of cultural, governmental and corporate power from sea to shining sea.",279053,,['Ben Shapiro'],"['the United States', 'American', 'Judeo-Christian']","['Herbert Marcuse', 'Shulamith Firestone', 'Marcuse', 'Firestone', 'Freud']",[],"['The Revolution', 'the Heart', '‘Pride', 'the advent', 'Pride Month', 'the most important sacrament', 'the American secular religious calendar', 'Pride Month', 'public schools', 'the nation', 'small children', 'the joys', 'alternative sexual practices', 'orientations', 'corporations', 'their stores', 'rainbow accoutrements', 'all sorts', 'the federal government', 'the United States', 'its fidelity', 'the LGBTQ+*&^% ideology', 'The American public', 'the most part', 'Pride Month', 'what', 'it', 'it', ': a call', 'tolerance', 'that', 'course', 'what', 'Pride Month', 'Pride Month', 'not a call', 'equality', 'a call', 'revolution', 'The Pride movement', 'a call', 'a replacement', 'historic, tried and true cultural norms', 'new, untried and risky cultural norms', 'Heteronormativity', 'one such tried and true norm', 'the correct belief', 'any durable society', 'the basis', 'male-female dyads', 'children', 'Such a norm', 'Pride', 'the opposite', 'heteronormativity', 'an authoritarian and discriminatory standard', 'that', 'artificial limits', 'the full flowering', 'human sexuality', 'the norm', 'human happiness', 'This', 'course', 'precisely the case', 'the original exponents', 'the sexual revolution', 'Herbert Marcuse', 'author', '“Eros', 'Civilization', 'a rewriting', 'all sexual norms', 'the capitalist structure', 'He', 'a non-repressive civilization', 'a fundamentally different experience', 'being', 'a fundamentally different relation', 'man', 'nature', 'fundamentally different existential relations', 'Such a civilization', 'the body', 'its entirety', 'an object', 'cathexis', 'a thing', 'an instrument', 'pleasure', 'Sex', 'marriage', 'parenthood', 'Marcuse', 'the barriers', 'absolute gratification', 'elements', 'human freedom', 'This sensuous rationality', 'its own moral laws', 'feminist Shulamith Firestone', 'sexual revolution', 'not just the elimination', 'male privilege', 'the sex distinction', 'itself', 'genital differences', 'human beings', 'Happiness', 'a “reversion', 'an unobstructed pansexuality', 'Freud’s ‘polymorphous perversity', 'hetero/homo/bi', '-', 'sexuality', 'We', 'the dystopia', 'Marcuse', 'Firestone', 'a world', 'which', 'all the elites', 'our society', 'the rewriting', 'durable societal norms', 'favor', 'unending sexual gratification', 'order', 'that dystopia', 'our societal elites', 'one more element', 'repression', 'the traditional norms', 'A fair fight', 'traditional Judeo-Christian norms', 'place', 'they', 'time', 'Marcuse', 'a solution', 'just such a problem', 'repression', 'Promotion', 'the new morality', 'L)iberation', 'the Damned', 'the Earth', 'suppression', 'their new masters', 'Marcuse', 'the culture war', 'old norms', 'They', 'Pride', 'the alternative', 'that revolution', 'the exercise', 'cultural, governmental and corporate power', 'sea', 'shining sea', 'None']"

Today's Morning Joe featured excerpts from Jacob Soboroff's Today show interview of Gavin Newsom, in which the California Governor floated the possibility that Ron DeSantis might be guilty of ""kidnapping"" for having flown migrants from New Mexico to Sacramento. 

Commenting on it, Scarborough said:


""I also think about flying immigrants up to the Naval Observatory. A lot of them in t-shirts, and dumping them outside of the Vice President's residence on Christmas eve, where it's freezing. Again, they think that they're owning Kamala Harris. All they're doing is showing just, just the core of their existence. 

""And on Christmas eve to do this to little three, four, five-year-old children in t-shirts, dumping them in freezing weather? For a political stunt? It seems politically depraved to me at least. And I think Newsom is underlining that fact now in an important way.""


Except . . . DeSantis didn't fly migrants to DC and have them dropped off near Kamala Harris's residence in late December 2022. That was the work of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as he has made clear.

For that matter, while some of the migrants were apparently wearing T-shirts, they were not left to suffer in the cold. As Politico has reported, employees of the relief agency working with the city of Washington:


""had blankets ready for the people who arrived on Christmas Eve and moved them quickly onto waiting buses for a ride to an area church.""


Either Scarborough was ignorant of the facts, or he intentionally misrepresented them. So who's ""politically depraved"" now?





DeSantis did arrange for migrants to be flown to tony Martha's Vineyard. But that was in late summer 2022. 

Readers are encouraged to view the excerpt of Newsom's interview in the clip. This was a man at peak, haughty arrogance. Calling DeSantis ""small and pathetic,"" Newsom superciliously said  that he was being ""very generous"" in doing so.

And how rich was it to hear Newsom accuse DeSantis of being ""desperate for attention?"" This from the guy who snared a national TV interview to peddle the attention-grabbing suggestion that a fellow governor was guilty of kidnapping. Even Katty Kay, who liked Newsom's performance, saw it as Newsom auditioning for a future presidential run against DeSantis. And legal experts, including a Berkeley law professor [!], have expressed the opinion that the facts do not support a kidnapping charge. 

Scarborough and Katty Kay were impressed by Newsom's imperious performance. Kay lauded the ""strength"" that Newsom projected, and Scarborough praised Newsom for underlining DeSantis' supposed depravity ""in an important way.""

Rather than being impressed, I found Newsom's swagger odiously reminiscent of another big-state governor: Eliot Spitzer of New York. Spitzer was the guy who threatened a Republican legislator, bragging: “I am a f---ing steamroller and I’ll roll over you or anybody else.”

Spitzer barely made one year in office before being forced to resign after it came to light that the married governor was a frequent customer of a high-priced escort service.

Not saying that Newsom will get ensnared in a similar scandal, but things have a way of not working out well for egotistical politicians drunk on their own power.

Joe Scarborough falsely accusing Ron DeSantis of dumping children in freezing weather while wearing t-shirts was sponsored in part by Kayak, Sandals, Ring, and Liberty Mutual.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: California Governor Gavin Newsom tells NBC News he plans to launch an investigation into flights of migrants flown from New Mexico to Sacramento, which were orchestrated by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, saying that he believes that it's clear that a crime was committed.

Florida officials confirmed the DeSantis administration organized two flights to fly migrants from New Mexico to Sacramento. In a statement releasedy esterday, Florida's Division of Emergency Management said, quote, through verbal and written consent, these volunteers indicated they wanted to go to California. The statement included this video of migrants allegedly on their way, about three dozen migrants were ultimately relocated. They said that they were recruited for the trip outside of a shelter in El Paso, Texas. Several said that they were promised help finding work.

Here is what California Governor Newsom told NBC's Jacob Soboroff in a Today exclusive.

JACOB SOBOROFF: These flights of asylum seekers that are being brought to Sacramento, there've been two of them now. They've been described as state-sanctioned kidnapping by the attorney general of this state of California.

You tweeted directly at the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. I want to get this right: you called him a small, pathetic man and asked, quote, kidnapping charges? 

Is that, is that what you believe happened, governor? The Governor of Florida kidnapped migrants and brought them to California?

GAVIN NEWSOM: I think I'm being generous, small and pathetic. Very generous. He's just weakness masquerading as strength. Yeah. He's flailing. Desperate for attention. Let's just level-set here, let's level-set. Here's a governor from the state of Florida that is using taxpayer money. And he had to go to another state to find people under false pretense.

I don't think this, I IIknow this. I talked to the migrants. Lied to them, took them into another state by bus, and then took them on a chartered flight to Sacramento, lying to them that they had help on the other side, knocked on the door and they left these migrants right there on the steps.

What kind of human being doesthat?

SOBOROFF: Ron DeSantis is going to be landing in this city later this month to hold a fundraiser for his presidential campaign.

NEWSOM: Yeah. Yeah.

SOBOROFF: Should he be worried that law enforcement officials in this state are going to arrest him when he walks off the plane?

NEWSOM: Now we're getting into hyperbole. Bottom line is --

SOBOROFF: Well, just respectfully, I mean, I don't think it's hyperbole. I mean, you're the one raising criminality potentially.

NEWSOM: Potentially, yeah. And we have to do the investigation. And so, it's ready, aim, fire. Not ready, fire, aim. That's his approach. Our approach is to seek first to collect all the facts. But on the basis of facts and evidence that were provided, and by the way, I didn't take this in the third party, right? I was there with these folks directly and listened to how they -- I mean, you know, human beings. Used as pawns for a guy's political advancement. That's pretty sad and pathetic.

And so, I take this very seriously and as I said, we are not Martha's Vineyard. I love Martha's vineyard, but this is California. Fourth or fifth largest economy on the planet Earth. We mean business. And so Ron Desantis should know that. And everyone that's been part of this, they may have more direct accountability and culpability, should know that we mean business and we're not backing away from getting the facts and holding those accountable if they broke the laws in the state of California.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Boy, you know, that's a fascinating interview and you can see more of Jacob's interview of the governor tomorrow on the Today show. And we're going to be following that story?

I did enjoy the cutaways where Jacob would be saying, well, you called it kidnapping. He's like [Scarborough imitates Newsom shrugging.] You say he's a small and pathetic man. What can I say? 

MIKA: [laughs heartily]

SCARBOROUGH: Do you think he's a kidnapper, is he running a humant rafficking ring? Ehh.

You know, the, the thing is though that he's doing --and I think it is so important, Katty, he is calling out the fact that if it's not criminal, and I don't know, perhaps it may be criminal, the attorney general in California thinks it does.

But even if it's not, it is abhorrent that Ron DeSantis is using human beings, not really for political gain, just simply to own the libs. And you know, we're talking about going to Sacramento here. But I think about, you know, you could talk about Martha's Vineyard, rounding up people, throwing them on a plane, so you could own the libs that go to Martha's Vineyard.

Like again, little children, their moms, grandparents, it's just heinous. But I also think about flying immigrants up to the Naval Observatory. A lot of them in t-shirts, and dumping them outside of the Vice President's residence on Christmas Eve, where it's freezing. Again, they think that they're owning Kamala Harris. All they're doing is showing just, just the core of their existence. 

And on Christmas Eve to do this to little three, four, five-year-old children in t-shirts, dumping them in freezing weather? For a political stunt? It seems politically depraved to me at least. And I think Newsom is underlining that fact now in an important way.

KATTY KAY: Yeah. By the way, did anyone else think that sounded like Gavin Newsom preparing to run against Ron DeSantis in four years time? Cause that, the way he was talking about DeSantis, the way he was projecting strength in that interview, it struck me as that.

You're right. And the other important point about that interview, we've heard a lot about, I don't know, rapists and drug runners coming across the border.

1647,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",New Twitter Files Upend CNN’s Ridiculous Gaslighting on Big Tech-Gov’t Censorship,"June 7th, 2023 5:12 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/joseph-vazquez/2023/06/07/new-twitter-files-upend-cnns-ridiculous-gaslighting-big,"Just as CNN didn't blink twice when it described ""fiery but mostly peaceful protests"" in 2020, the joke of a media outlet is telling Twitter Files readers ""don't believe your lying eyes"" when it comes to Big Tech-Big Government censorship collusion.

 CNN published what amounted to a Big Tech-Big Government press release June 6 headlined: “Twitter’s own lawyers refute Elon Musk’s claim that The ‘Twitter Files’ exposed US government censorship.” CNN’s sources? The lawyers for the censorship-obsessed, pre-Musk Twitter regime in Donald J. Trump v. Twitter, Inc.

Wow, who would have thought that people paid to defend pre-Musk Twitter would do just that! “Twitter’s own lawyers are disputing those claims in a case involving former President Donald Trump — forcefully rejecting any suggestion that the Twitter Files show what Musk and many Republicans assert they contain,” CNN claimed.

Talk about awful timing.

Just a day after CNN’s spin, The Grayzone News host Aaron Maté released a batch of “New Twitter Files” showing that the FBI actively assisted Ukrainian intelligence in censoring Twitter users and journalists accused of spreading so-called “disinformation” and “fear.” 

 Specifically, per Maté, “In March 2022, an FBI Special Agent sent Twitter a list of accounts on behalf of the SBU, Ukraine’s main intelligence agency. The accounts, the FBI wrote, ‘are suspected by the SBU in spreading fear and disinformation.’”

Twitter reportedly “agreed to review the accounts but raised concerns about its inclusion of ‘American and Canadian journalists” such as  Maté. Twitter Files journalist Matt Taibbi made it a point of calling the latest batch of Twitter Files released by Maté the ""most damning about the FBI, showing that it is willing to help a foreign government try to suppress a prominent Western journalist.""


Of all the #TwitterFiles stories, this one is perhaps the most damning about the FBI, showing that it is willing to help a foreign government try to suppress a prominent Western journalist. It's outrageous and provides further evidence the FBI is out of control. https://t.co/iNwgJxYe2O
— Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) June 7, 2023
But, as CNN spun, “Twitter’s attorneys contested one of the most central allegations to emerge from the Twitter Files: that regular communications between the FBI and Twitter ahead of the 2020 election amounted to government coercion to censor content or, worse, that Twitter had become an actual arm of the US government.” Oof. 


Many media pundits, all of whom also happened to be Russiagate dupes, went to great effort to dismiss the Twitter Files.
My prediction is that they will ignore this one: https://t.co/CKglm0wOhx

“As cited in Norwood v. Harrison, ‘It is also axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish,'” said MRC Free Speech America & MRC Business Director Michael Morris. “Or does CNN suggest that government can accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish — in this case, by government limiting the constitutionally protected speech of Americans by applying pressure to — or working in coordination with — Big Tech companies?” 

CNN also cited Big Tech and the FBI’s denials, as if that was strong evidence. For example, the agency reportedly paid Twitter $3.4 million between 2019 and 2021 “for the time spent processing requests from the FBI.” But CNN ridiculously asserted that the payments were simply “routine reimbursements for responding to subpoenas and investigations, not payments for content moderation decisions.” Right, because it couldn’t possibly also be for looking into the lists of hundreds of accounts that the FBI sent Twitter, eh CNN?

CNN accused Twitter owner Elon Musk of “baseless claims that the US government illegally coerced Twitter into censoring a 2020 New York Post article about Hunter Biden.” That’s despite the fact that former Head of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth acknowledged having met weekly with the FBI who knew about the laptop for nearly a year before the New York Post released its report.

Yet, in a statement to the Federal Election Commission, Roth said,  “federal law enforcement agencies communicated [to Twitter] that they expected ‘hack-and-leak operations’ by state actors” and that such operations “might occur in the period shortly before the 2020 presidential election, likely in October.” He later added that the FBI even informed him that the leak was rumored to “involve Hunter Biden.” 

CNN simply bypassed all of this by taking the lawyers for the prior Twitter regime’s word for it that the Twitter Files don’t show coercion because they “‘don’t contain a specific government demand to remove content—let alone one backed by the threat of government sanction.” 

CNN peddled an excuse for the FBI flagging content to Twitter leadership too. “Even the FBI’s flagging of specific problematic tweets were merely suggestions that they might violate Twitter’s terms of service, not a request that they be removed or an implication of retribution if Twitter failed to take the tweets down, Twitter’s lawyers said.”

But this misses the point. Taibbi even reported that evidence showed that “agencies like the FBI and DHS [were] regularly sending social media content to Twitter through multiple entry points, pre-flagged for moderation.” As Taibbi noted, “[A] surprisingly high number [of emails]  are requests by the FBI for Twitter to take action on election misinformation, even involving joke tweets from low-follower accounts.”

1648,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Stelter On His CNN Tenure: 'We Were Advocating For The Truth',"June 7th, 2023 3:23 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/alex-christy/2023/06/07/stelter-his-cnn-tenure-we-were-advocating-truth,"Former CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter journeyed over to CNBC’s The Exchange on Wednesday to react to Chris Licht stepping down as CEO of CNN and to claim that he and others opposed to Licht’s vision were simply “advocating for the truth.” Meanwhile, in other humorous developments, CNBC.com media reporter Alex Sherman condemned Licht for killing off CNN’s “north star”: CNN+.

Stelter’s comments where set up by Sherman present the dilemma that Licht’s eventual replacement will face:


The question now is if you’re going to find a new leader, do you task that new leader with a new vision for CNN? Or do you just keep, kind of, repeating the same things you've been saying about CNN like, ‘well, it used to be an advocacy network and now we want to make it, sort of this, down this middle, we want to bring in more Republicans, we want both sides.’ These are the types of things [Warner Bros. Discovery CEO] David Zaslav has talked about from CNN, but I don't know if that’s enough of a vision to get everyone there on board with the mission.” 


 





 

One of those who was not onboard with that vision was Stelter, which is why he was sacked by Licht and was now appearing on CNBC. He explained that “A lot of us when we were at CNN in the Trump years felt we were advocating for the truth, advocating for reality. Others felt that was left-leaning.”

Others felt that way because it was and Stelter was one of the biggest voices for that activist approach. Unwittingly confirming his critics correct, Stelter argued that it is almost impossible for CNN to follow a “just the facts” sort of journalism, ""I think it is right to have this desire to have a much more calm, less controversial political environment that CNN can then cover, but we don't live in that world. In fact, if anything it’s only going to get more chaotic with Donald Trump as the leading contender for the GOP nomination.""

Stelter followed up by claiming that CNN cannot be “all things to all people” because that means “you’re not anything to anybody and that’s the CNN challenge, it always has been, for 40 years, to just try to be the plain vanilla news, well, in an environment where people don't just want plain, vanilla news.”

While it was nice of Stelter to admit that when forced to choose between its hysterically anti-Trump audience and “vanilla news,” CNN chose the former, Sherman would later bring in some comedy.

He argued that “there needs to be more of a vision than just ‘you got to take down the breaking news, we got to turn down the knob here.’”

Admitting that CNN+ has “sort of half-baked,” it represented “a north star for CNN” that could possibly have worked if Licht had just given it more time:

It was something where they said the linear world is hemorrhaging millions of subscribers every year, more and more people cancel cable, so let's make this new thing and, yeah, the ratings are going to be lower, but we can tell investors, we can tell our employees “look we're building a new subscription business, it’ll take time, but that’s where we’re going.” When they killed that off, there was no there there anymore. 

More like a black hole. If people weren’t watching CNN with their basic cable package, why would they pay for it by itself? Especially when people like Stelter can’t tell the difference between truth and their own spin.

ALEX SHERMAN: The question now is if you’re going to find a new leader, do you task that new leader with a new vision for CNN? Or do you just keep, kind of, repeating the same things you've been saying about CNN like, “well, it used to be an advocacy network and now we want to make it, sort of this, down this middle, we want to bring in more Republicans, we want both sides.”

BRIAN STELTER: A lot of us when we were at CNN in the Trump years felt we were advocating for the truth, advocating for reality. Others felt that was left-leaning, but the point is CNN was evolving because of the political environment and I don’t think there’s a way to turn—

KELLY EVANS: You mean it was evolving anyhow before Chris Licht and—interesting.

STELTER: Before Licht was arriving, yes, and, you know, I think it is right to have this desire to have a much more calm, less controversial political environment that CNN can then cover, but we don't live in that world. In fact, if anything it’s only going to get more chaotic with Donald Trump as the leading contender for the GOP nomination.

I had an anchor today say to me, you know, if you try to be all things to all people, you’re not anything to anybody and that’s the CNN challenge, it always has been, for 40 years, to just try to be the plain vanilla news, well, in an environment where people don't just want plain, vanilla news. 

…

SHERMAN: But there needs to be more of a vision than just “you got to take down the breaking news, we got to turn down the knob here” Part of, again, one of the big things he did when first stepped in the role was kill of CNN+ and that was, for better or worse, and you can certainly make an argument that, that was sort of a half-baked product and shouldn't have been launched when had and maybe was a product of the merger happening and trying to rush it out before Discovery took over, but at least it was a north star for CNN. It was something where they said the linear world is hemorrhaging millions of subscribers every year, more and more people cancel cable, so let's make this new thing and, yeah, the ratings are going to be lower, but we can tell investors, we can tell our employees “look we're building a new subscription business, it’ll take time, but that’s where we’re going.” When they killed that off, there was no there there anymore.",279049,,['Alex Christy'],['Republicans'],"['David Zaslav', 'SHERMAN', 'Stelter', 'STELTER', 'KELLY EVANS', 'Trump', 'BRIAN STELTER', 'Brian Stelter', 'Donald Trump', 'Alex Sherman', 'ALEX SHERMAN', 'Sherman', 'Chris Licht', 'Licht']","['The Exchange', 'Warner Bros.

1649,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",Soros-Funded NPR Defends Soros-Tied Voting Org from So-Called ‘Far-Right’ Misinfo ‘Machine’,"June 7th, 2023 2:59 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/nicholas-schau/2023/06/07/soros-funded-npr-defends-soros-tied-voting-org-so-called,"NPR ludicrously claimed that the leftist Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) was not influenced by George Soros funding, despite NPR itself being funded by the leftist billionaire.

In an article published June 4, NPR complained about waning support for ERIC — an organization focused on voter registration — in Republican states and ridiculously attributed the ire over its Soros ties to a so-called “far-right misinformation machine.” However, according to the Capital Research Center (CRC), there is real evidence that Soros’ network provided funding for the organization, which was established as a project of The Pew Charitable Trusts. According to CRC investigative researcher Parker Thayer, “NPR’s insistence that there is no connection between ERIC and George Soros is laughable and refuted by their own article.”

Specifically, as Thayer pointed out, “[NPR] admit[ted] several paragraphs into the article that Soros’s private foundation provided money to the organization that created the ERIC but spen[t] the rest of the same article insisting that there is no connection.”

NPR called the association between Soros and the ERIC a “false alleged Soros connection.”

It’s worth noting that NPR itself has also been funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations to the tune of at least $600,000 in 2016 alone. In addition, Fox News also reported on Dec. 23, 2015 that Soros granted almost $2 million “to hire 100 new reporters for 50 of [NPR’s] member stations.” Of course, NPR conveniently didn’t disclose this apparent conflict of interest when it was busy shilling for Soros in its propaganda piece. “NPR ought to be ashamed of misrepresenting the facts about ERIC and its ties to George Soros so severely,” Thayer rebuked.

While NPR acknowledged that Soros donated money to Pew— which initiated ERIC — the outlet still had the audacity to insinuate that “Soros has never had any involvement in the organization.” However, Soros clearly had monetary influence over the organization according to the CRC’s analysis. CRC noted that the funding for the project appeared to have originated with Soros’ Foundation to Promote Open Society, “which funneled two grants to Pew in 2011 totaling $725,000” precisely for its voter registration efforts. “If that’s not a description of ERIC then nothing is,” Thayer retorted. 

According to CRC, “The first [grant] was ‘to support the Pew Center on the States’ voter registration modernization initiative,’ while the second funded ‘renewed project support to the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Elections Initiatives to modernize voter registration systems and to provide new project support to elections initiatives to expand the scope and scale of the voter information project.’” As Thayer noted, “[i]f that’s not a description of ERIC then nothing is.”

But that’s not all, as CRC analyzed:


Independent journalists have also uncovered references to Pew’s voter registration activities in a leaked copy of the Open Society Foundations’ 2011–12 budget. That document lists Pew Center on the States as a ‘lead grantee’ alongside the Brennan Center and Advancement Project, which oppose voter ID laws and support the Left’s array of election ‘reforms’ including Election Day registration.


But according to NPR, none of this signals “involvement.” But perhaps NPR’s gaslighting stems from the fact that it also received funding from Soros.

Hostin, who’s a racist and mentally unstable, caused an embarrassing scene as she personally attacked Farah Griffin and wouldn’t let her speak in her own defense. Moderator Whoopi Goldberg was forced to go to a commercial because of Hostin’s behavior, but not before Farah Griffin invoked the name of the show’s founder: Barbara Walters.

Hostin’s childish fit came as they were discussing former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie joining the race. “He's a spineless soulless – That’s – that’s – that’s – that’s – that’s - that’s - that’s – that’s – Chris Christie is – is – is – is not a factor here in – in my view,” she struggled to get her hatred out.

 





 

According to her, he only joined the race because “he wants power.” “How does he get the power by entering in the race, though, knowing he can’t win?” Farah Griffin, the self-described conservative wondered.

That simple question to probe Hostin’s logic triggered a complete mental meltdown, lashing out at Farah Griffin directly and refusing to let her respond (Click “expand”):


HOSTIN: I think he thinks he's special! But what scares me, Alyssa, is that you are incapable of defending a man that you worked for. That you know of.

FARAH GRIFFIN: I am – oh, no, no. Why don’t you ask me a question rather than –

HOSTIN: And you’re saying you need to hear –

JOY BEHAR: I did ask you a question.

HOSTIN: – she did. And you said that you needed to hear more from him. And I don't need to hear more from Pence for several reasons.


“Well, you just accused me of something, so why don't you let me actually answer? You’re not going to vote for a Republican ever,” Farah Griffin attempted to push back. “Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm going to finish what I'm going to say,” the self-entitled, chronically aggrieved multimillionaire shot back, suggesting “a lot of people died because of” former Vice President Mike Pence when he was governor of Indiana during the AIDS epidemic.

Farah Griffin called out Hostin’s hypocrisy in supporting bad candidates because she defended Cornel West on Tuesday despite his support for America’s adversaries like Russia. Hostin continued refusing Farah Griffin the chance to respond:


FARAH GRIFFIN: I mean, you just defended Cornel West yesterday, who would destroy our country so-

HOSTIN: I’m still speaking. I'm still speaking. He was also a parrot for Trump. He spearheaded –

BEHAR: Don’t make this personal. Let’s hear.

HOSTIN: Spearheaded the Trump – He spear –


“Sunny likes to make it personal with me. Are you going to give me a chance to answer?” Farah Griffin pressed the rest of the cast. “Well, I’m just speaking the truth,” Hostin sneered.

Appearing to finally grow a spine, Farah Griffin invoked the show’s founder and blasted Hostin for treating the show as her own fiefdom:


FARAH GRIFFIN: This is not what the show is about. This is Barbara Walters’ legacy. Let a woman speak.

HOSTIN: It’s everybody’s view. It’s everybody’s view.

FARAH GRIFFIN: It’s everybody’s view? No, it’s Sunny Hostin’s view.


Interestingly, Farah Griffin got applause from the normally liberal audience who sat there awkwardly for most of Hostin’s tirade.

Co-hosts Sara Haines and Joy Behar tried to intercede on Farah Griffin’s behalf but were also steamrolled by their unhinged fellow. “Are you going to keep going or am I going to get a chance?” Farah Griffin shouted in frustration. “I’m not giving up because I’m not finished,” Hostin told her.

Completely fed up with the spectacle, Goldberg brought the hammer down and went to a commercial. “I feel like I need to go to break now,” she said in disgust. “So, maybe we need to just figure out how we do this again. Let's have this break and let's figure out how we're going to make this work. We'll be right back.”

“It’s hard when you’re being interrupted. It’s hard when you’re being interrupted,” Hostin whined.

Following the break, things were calmed down and they proceeded without incident.

Sunny Hostin’s hatred was made possible because lucrative sponsorships from CarShield and Unilever. Their contact information is linked.

SUNNY HOSTIN: That's not Chris Christie. He's a spineless soulless – That’s - that’s - that’s – that’s – that’s - that’s - that’s – that’s - Chris Christie is – is – is – is not a factor here in - in my view.

SARA HAINES: Why do you think he’s joining?

HOSTIN: I think he’s pugilistic. I think he wants power. I think he wants so much power that in 2017, he closed public beaches to all of New Jersey except for his family and his son so he could have his son’s birthday party on the beach. I think he thinks he's special!

ALYSSA FARAH GRIFF: How does he get the power by entering in the race, though, knowing he can’t win?

HOSTIN: I think he thinks he's special! But what scares me, Alyssa, is that you are incapable of defending a man that you worked for. That you know of.

FARAH GRIFFIN: I am – Oh, no, no. Why don’t you ask me a question rather than --

HOSTIN: And you’re saying you need to hear--

JOY BEHAR: I did ask you a question.

HOSTIN: She did. And you said that you needed to hear more from him. And I don't need to hear more from Pence for several reasons. Because when I lived in Indiana –

FARAH GRIFFIN: Well, you just accused me of something, so why don't you let me actually answer. You’re not going to vote for a Republican ever.

HOSTIN: Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm going to finish what I'm going to say. The thing about Pence here is that when lived in Indiana and I went to Notre Dame, he had a terrible approval rating because of the way he treated the AIDS crisis. Awful. Lot of people died because of him. Lot of people died because of how he handled the COVID crisis.

FARAH GRIFFIN: I mean, you just defended Cornell West yesterday, who would destroy our country so-

HOSTIN: I’m still speaking. I'm still speaking. He was also a parrot for Trump. He spearheaded –

BEHAR: Don’t make this personal. Let’s hear.

HOSTIN: Spearheaded the Trump – He spear –

FARAH GRIFFIN: Sunny likes to make it personal with me. Are you going to give me a chance to answer?

HOSTIN: Well, I’m just speaking the truth. Spearheading troop – Trump’s COVID agenda of downplaying the virus.

FARAH GRIFFIN: This is not what the show is about. This is Barbara Walters’ legacy. Let a woman speak.

HOSTIN: It’s everybody’s view. It’s everybody’s view.

FARAH GRIFFIN: It’s everybody’s view? No, it’s Sunny Hostin’s view.

[Applause]

HOSTIN: And Pence did not quarantine himself –

HAINES: And Joy, you didn’t ask her to defend. You asked why would someone vote for him.

BEHAR: Yes.

FARAH GRIFFIN (to Hostin): Are you going to keep going or are am I going to get a chance?

HOSTIN: I’m not giving up because I’m not finished.

BEHAR: Yes. Let her answer my question.

GOLDBERG: I feel like I need to go to break now.

[Crosstalk]

[Applause]

BEHAR: No, no, no. She’s ready to answer the question.

GOLDBERG Because I can't hear anybody saying anything.

HOSTIN: It’s hard when you’re being interrupted. It’s hard when you’re being interrupted.

GOLDBERG: So, maybe we need to just figure out how we do this again. Let's have this break and let's figure out how we're going to make this work.

1651,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing","Too Little, Too Late! 4 Cases Show Draconian Nature of YouTube’s Election Censorship Policy","June 7th, 2023 2:21 PM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/bethany-kawalec/2023/06/07/too-little-too-late-4-cases-show-draconian-nature,"After years of shamelessly censoring discussions of the 2020 presidential election, YouTube has changed its election misinformation policy, but the damage has already been done.

 YouTube announced Friday that the platform “will stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US Presidential elections.” Although the platform continued to press its own stance on the last election, YouTube admitted that in this case censorship perhaps wasn’t the answer: “In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.” You don’t say?  

The change in policy is long overdue. By YouTube’s own admission, the censorship caused devastating damage, spanning “two years, tens of thousands of video removals, and one election cycle later.”

As users say “good riddance” to YouTube’s draconian censorship rule, here are four cases showing how the anti-free speech platform enforced its election misinformation policy:

YouTube suspended The Hill’s channel for posting videos containing Trump’s statements on voter fraud. According to a report by Robby Soave–senior editor for Reason and co-host of The Hill’s show, Rising–YouTube suspended The Hill’s channel for videos containing statements made by former President Donald Trump about election integrity. The platform allegedly found two videos problematic. Soave wrote that one video showed “raw footage of Trump's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 26, during which he made false claims about the election.” The Hill’s other video contained a clip of Trump’s comment that “the Russian invasion of Ukraine is only happening because of a rigged election.” YouTube told MRC at the time that it suspended The Hill for “violating our election integrity policy.” The outlet could not post videos or livestream for seven days.
YouTube removed a clip posted by the January 6 Committee for lacking “sufficient context.” The Congressional January 6 Committee posted part of a hearing that included clips of former President Trump alleging widespread voter fraud. In the video, Trump said: “We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account. They're not glitches. They're theft. They're fraud, absolute fraud.”Former Attorney General Bill Barr repeatedly denied Trump’s claims at the hearing, but the clip did not include Barr’s denials. YouTube told MRC Free Speech America that its “election integrity policy prohibits content advancing false claims that widespread fraud, errors or glitches changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election if it does not provide sufficient context.” 
YouTube removed two days of CPAC 2022 videos. The platform removed two days’ worth of content posted by the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). YouTube told MRC Free Speech America that it removed the videos for “violating our election integrity policy which prohibits content that advances false claims that widespread fraud changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.” Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, told The Washington Examiner that he received a notice that YouTube had removed former President Trump’s speech as well. Schlapp said that “many speakers did not focus on the election.” However, the CPAC channel received a strike for showing so-called “misinformation.”
YouTube removed a DC Clips interview with a January 6 rioter. DC Clips, a channel run by a New York Post reporter, posted an interview with January 6 rioter Aaron Mostofsky inside the Capitol. The Post reported that the video “was cited by many news outlets and the Justice Department used it to help prosecute Mostofsky.” YouTube removed the video claiming that the video “advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of the US 2020 presidential election.” YouTube later permitted the same content to remain on the Post’s channel, according to the Post.

1652,"Newsbusters - Welcome to NewsBusters, a project of the Media Research Center (MRC), America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing",WashPost Throws Four Pinocchios at Nikki Haley to Echo Lefty Twitter,"June 7th, 2023 10:55 AM",https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2023/06/07/washpost-throws-four-pinocchios-nikki-haley-echo-lefty-twitter,"For the leftists on Twitter, the most ""notorious"" moment of Nikki Haley's CNN town hall with Jake Tapper was her assertion that biological boys in the locker room were spurring suicidal thoughts among girls: “How are we supposed to get our girls used to the fact that biological boys are in their locker rooms? And then we wonder why a third of our teenage girls seriously contemplated suicide last year.”

Washington Post ""Fact Checker"" Glenn Kessler then followed quickly behind and threw Four Pinocchios -- ""Pants on Fire"" Lie! -- at Haley for daring to say such a thing. 


Wow. Nikki Haley just said teenage girls are contemplating suicide because transgender girls are “in their locker room.” pic.twitter.com/IeGYVWKdBH
— No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen (@NoLieWithBTC) June 5, 2023
Haley's campaign responded to Kessler's request for comment: 


When we asked the Haley campaign why the candidate made this link, her spokesman responded with a statement he said was from Haley herself: “We have to grow strong girls, and that is being threatened right now. Whether it’s biological boys going into girls’ locker rooms or playing in girls’ sports, women are being told their voices don’t matter. If you think this kind of aggressive bullying isn’t part of the problem, you’re not paying attention.”


Kessler said that doesn't answer a request for evidence that boys in the locker room are spurring suicide. Kessler pointed out that there's no evidence of a survey that shows a suicide connection. That's a fact. So this is a valid item for a Fact Checker.

 But it shows once again that the Post's idea of who and what to check is driven by the Left. The target selection is mostly Republican. You have to go back a month to May 4 to find Kessler checking a Democrat right now. Some might argue that Haley was more likely to be attacked by accepting an appearance on CNN. Republicans should take up CNN on an offer like this, but we might guess Lefty Twitter would get less upset if Haley sent the same message on Fox or Newsmax. 

Also remember Kessler has a habit to withhold Pinocchios on Democrats. Kamala Harris lying that they had to ""start from scratch"" on a COVID vaccine drew TWO Pinocchios.

One reason why this inspired so much rage on Lefty Twitter is because they constantly suggest conservatives are spurring suicidal thoughts among trans youth by daring to oppose them. Use their preferred pronouns -- or else! Of course, Jake Tapper responded to Haley with that:  ""According to the Trevor Project, half of trans people and non-binary young people have seriously considered suicide in the past year. A lot of these [leftist] efforts are about trying to stop that."" That's weaponized against critics: stop opposing us, or you want us dead.

Leftist media don't underline the Trevor Project is a very ideological group. They insist ""LGBTQ youth are not inherently prone to suicide risk because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, but rather placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society."" Would Kessler fact-check that assertion? Or are they immune from scrutiny?

The Trevor Project speaks the gospel of intersectionality, that the marginalized ""are shaped by interlocking systems of privilege and oppression at the societal level, such as heterosexism, cisgenderism, and racism."" These are the conspiracy theories that go unchecked by ""fact checkers.""",279037,,['Tim Graham'],"['Republicans', 'Republican', 'Democrats', 'Democrat']","['Kamala Harris', 'Glenn Kessler', 'Jake Tapper', ""Nikki Haley's"", 'Kessler', 'Haley', 'Nikki Haley']","['Newsmax', 'WashPost', 'Post', 'Washington Post', 'CNN', 'the Trevor Project', 'Fox', 'Lefty Twitter', 'The Trevor Project']","['WashPost', 'Four Pinocchios', 'Nikki Haley', 'Lefty Twitter', 'the leftists', 'Twitter', 'the most ""notorious"" moment', ""Nikki Haley's CNN town hall"", 'Jake Tapper', 'her assertion', 'biological boys', 'the locker room', 'suicidal thoughts', 'girls', 'we', 'our girls', 'the fact', 'biological boys', 'their locker rooms', 'we', 'a third', 'our teenage girls', 'suicide', 'Washington Post ""Fact Checker"" Glenn Kessler', 'Four Pinocchios', 'Fire', 'Haley', 'such a thing', 'Nikki Haley', 'teenage girls', 'suicide', 'transgender girls', 'their locker room', 'No Lie', 'Brian Tyler Cohen', '@NoLieWithBTC', ""Haley's campaign"", ""Kessler's request"", 'comment', 'we', 'the Haley campaign', 'the candidate', 'this link', 'her spokesman', 'a statement', 'he', 'Haley', 'herself', 'We', 'strong girls', 'that', 'it', 'biological boys', 'girls’ locker rooms', 'girls’ sports', 'women', 'their voices', 'you', 'this kind', 'aggressive bullying', 'part', 'the problem', 'you', 'attention', 'Kessler', 'that', 'a request', 'evidence', 'boys', 'the locker room', 'suicide', 'Kessler', 'no evidence', 'a survey', 'that', 'a suicide connection', 'That', 'a fact', 'this', 'a valid item', 'a Fact Checker', 'it', ""the Post's idea"", 'who', 'what', 'the Left', 'The target selection', 'You', 'May', 'Kessler', 'a Democrat', 'Some', 'Haley', 'an appearance', 'CNN', 'Republicans', 'CNN', 'an offer', 'this', 'we', 'Lefty Twitter', 'Haley', 'the same message', 'Fox', 'Newsmax', 'Kessler', 'a habit', 'Pinocchios', 'Democrats', 'Kamala Harris', 'they', 'scratch', 'a COVID vaccine', 'TWO Pinocchios', 'One reason', 'this', 'so much rage', 'Lefty Twitter', 'they', 'conservatives', 'suicidal thoughts', 'trans youth', 'them', 'their preferred pronouns', 'Jake Tapper', 'Haley', 'that', 'the Trevor Project', 'half', 'trans people', 'non-binary young people', 'suicide', 'the past year', 'A lot', 'these [leftist] efforts', 'that', 'That', 'critics', 'us', 'you', 'us', 'Leftist media', 'the Trevor Project', 'a very ideological group', 'They', 'LGBTQ youth', 'suicide risk', 'their sexual orientation', 'gender identity', 'higher risk', 'they', 'society', 'Kessler', 'that assertion', 'they', 'scrutiny', 'The Trevor Project', 'the gospel', 'intersectionality', 'interlocking systems', 'privilege', 'oppression', 'the societal level', 'heterosexism', 'cisgenderism', 'racism', 'These', 'the conspiracy theories', 'that', 'fact checkers', 'None']"

The basic concept is stakes are driven into the ground off the runway then a chain is hooked to the winch line of a Humvee or armored vehicle and wrapped around the stakes so that when the winch line is recalled, or the vehicle moves, the chain sweeps the UXOs off the airfield as the chain goes taut.

It’s a tried and true method, but it’s dependent on the availability of an armored vehicle to protect the EOD team, a commodity not always available in the temporary austere mission locations EOD specialists are sometimes deployed to with great airpower but limited mission support equipment.

To augment the oversight, Miller developed and blueprinted a custom timer winch, stake and chain set. In theory, it’ll be the “chain drag” method and a new “hook and line” method Miller developed packed into one or two pelican cases for easy movement.
